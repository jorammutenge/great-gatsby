positive,"The Great Gatsby - Discipline of Craftsmanship. The Great Gatsby, along with Gone with the Wind and The Grapes of Wrath achieved something quite rare in the world of literature. They all defined an era of American history.In the case of The Great Gatsby, one of the greatest novels of the 20th century, it defined the America of the 1920s. Published in 1925, this book has never gone out of print. What makes this book live on for so long? Why is it still taught in the classroom? Why does it not appear to be dated?The answer is the carefully constructed prose that fills each and every page of the book. It reads like a piece of music. It is lyrical in both tone and substance. It is also about the romance of power and money. This resonates today and will never go out of style.The story is told in the third person. The narrator, Nick Caraway is a young clerk at a banking firm who has moved from the Midwest to NY to try his hand at making it big. He has rented a small cottage in a fashionable village of Long Island, called ""West Egg"" in the novel. This location, a place of quiet natural allure and the other village called ""East Egg"" is reminiscent of the North Shore villages of Long Island, Kings Point and Sands Point, respectively.His neighbor is and is not a contrast to the mellow, self-effacing Caraway. Just next door, separated by a vast lawn of carefully cut grass, is the estate of Jay Gatsby, a shy self-invented tycoon of sorts, who throws lavish parties on the lawn, never shows his face to many people and who secretly Caraway admires for his incredible success. It is summer, and this is the setting for a majority of the novel.In a way, it is also partly autobiographical. Fitzgerald came from the Midwest as does Nick Caraway, the narrator. And since Fitzgerald was writing about his contemporaries of the present day in the 1920s, it is worth noting that he knew at least partly of the kind of life that is so richly described in this book.Gatsby is a powerful man with few friends but many associates who help him get things done. Soon after, Gatsby invites Caraway over to one of the parties and is introduced to him. There is a purpose for this. Nick is the cousin of the other main character, Daisy Buchanan, whom Gatsby was engaged to years earlier. Gatsby's main purpose is to rekindle the romance with Daisy by asking Nick to ask Daisy to come over to Caraway's cottage so Gatsby can meet her there. Kind of convoluted but it is fascinating how Fitzgerald's natural talent at storytelling and his keen eye for dialogue and descriptiveness is what makes the novel endearing, even if the characters themselves are not.For example, this is a passage that describes how Nick feels about Daisy's singing.""Daisy began to sing with the music in a husky rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. When the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.""Another passage describes an early encounter between Gatsby and Daisy, years before. ""His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy's white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the tuning fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At his lip's touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.""Daisy Buchanan is by nature a very loving person, who speaks from the heart, but she is selfish and immature but without a streak of meanness. Her husband, Tom Buchanan is very well to do. He rides horses and is very aggressive in his likes and dislikes. He is also condescending and interrupts Daisy when she is speaking so he can have his say. The characters in this novel are fast living and afraid as they approach middle age and they are all disillusioned about life. Idle gossip is the norm as the characters swelter in the heat of summer.This novel appeals to both men and women because in every scene men and women figure prominently. There is nothing is this novel that is archaic or that would even give the impression that it's about the 1920s. It is to Fitzgerald's talent and sheer hard work of rewriting until it was right that every scene is suggestive of thought and mood by characters that at the core are superficial and ignorant of anything beyond their pursuits. They want to have a good time regardless of consequences. They can be wild and sassy beasts, full of rage and bliss.Gatsby is a wealthy private man with romantic speculation. Caraway on his lunch hour walks down Fifth Avenue and imagines himself as boyfriend to the various women who pass by, living a better life, maybe a life like Gatsby's.There is the need to be accepted by improving one's social position; afraid of going to the poor house. It is the wariness of inventing one's self to fit in that is dramatized every so subtly on every page; a desire to belong to that special group of snobs but never really trusting any of them. The morale of the story is that money and position do not last. It is the dream of obtaining it and never giving up that is attractive.This novel is a masterpiece of literature where style surpasses everything else, including splendidly invented characters.Review by Charles Blanchardauthor of Mourning Doves After The Fire",5532,"the great gatsby - discipline of craftsmanship. the great gatsby, along with gone with the wind and the grapes of wrath achieved something quite rare in the world of literature. they all defined an era of american history.in the case of the great gatsby, one of the greatest novels of the 20th century, it defined the america of the 1920s. published in 1925, this book has never gone out of print. what makes this book live on for so long? why is it still taught in the classroom? why does it not appear to be dated?the answer is the carefully constructed prose that fills each and every page of the book. it reads like a piece of music. it is lyrical in both tone and substance. it is also about the romance of power and money. this resonates today and will never go out of style.the story is told in the third person. the narrator, nick caraway is a young clerk at a banking firm who has moved from the midwest to ny to try his hand at making it big. he has rented a small cottage in a fashionable village of long island, called ""west egg"" in the novel. this location, a place of quiet natural allure and the other village called ""east egg"" is reminiscent of the north shore villages of long island, kings point and sands point, respectively.his neighbor is and is not a contrast to the mellow, self-effacing caraway. just next door, separated by a vast lawn of carefully cut grass, is the estate of jay gatsby, a shy self-invented tycoon of sorts, who throws lavish parties on the lawn, never shows his face to many people and who secretly caraway admires for his incredible success. it is summer, and this is the setting for a majority of the novel.in a way, it is also partly autobiographical. fitzgerald came from the midwest as does nick caraway, the narrator. and since fitzgerald was writing about his contemporaries of the present day in the 1920s, it is worth noting that he knew at least partly of the kind of life that is so richly described in this book.gatsby is a powerful man with few friends but many associates who help him get things done. soon after, gatsby invites caraway over to one of the parties and is introduced to him. there is a purpose for this. nick is the cousin of the other main character, daisy buchanan, whom gatsby was engaged to years earlier. gatsby's main purpose is to rekindle the romance with daisy by asking nick to ask daisy to come over to caraway's cottage so gatsby can meet her there. kind of convoluted but it is fascinating how fitzgerald's natural talent at storytelling and his keen eye for dialogue and descriptiveness is what makes the novel endearing, even if the characters themselves are not.for example, this is a passage that describes how nick feels about daisy's singing.""daisy began to sing with the music in a husky rhythmic whisper, bringing out a meaning in each word that it had never had before and would never have again. when the melody rose, her voice broke up sweetly, following it, in a way contralto voices have, and each change tipped out a little of her warm human magic upon the air.""another passage describes an early encounter between gatsby and daisy, years before.

consequences they can be wild and sassy beasts full of rage and bliss gatsby is a wealthy private man with romantic speculation caraway on his lunch hour walks down fifth avenue and imagines himself as boyfriend to the various women who pass by living a better life maybe a life like gatsby s there is the need to be accepted by improving one s social position afraid of going to the poor house it is the wariness of inventing one s self to fit in that is dramatized every so subtly on every page a desire to belong to that special group of snobs but never really trusting any of them the morale of the story is that money and position do not last it is the dream of obtaining it and never giving up that is attractive this novel is a masterpiece of literature where style surpasses everything else

positive,"One of the best American novels.. I read this book for my American literature class back in collage, and I loved it so much. The whole idea of the rise of the new rich after the World War reminds me much of what has happened to Kuwait after the Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait took place in the 1990. Much has changed in the status of people in society, somewhat I could relate much to the novel from what I have seen and heard of changes in Kuwait compared to what happened in America.The novel is very well-written and describes the crises of what people go through and what the American society went through at the time. The character of Gatsby is fascinating filled with mystery and adventure, yet at times one would sympathize with the character at time especially the beginning of his life. People at the time had to make an appearance of being rich to cope with survival in the environment of the fortunate ones.The green light Gastby used to see from his house at Daisy's house resembles his dream to live with her, very much associated with the ""American Dream"" and the ""Green"" land of which the first settlers in America saw.Much to be discussed about such a great American Novel.

positive,"A cultural touchstone, regardless of quality. I think I've mentioned this in other reviews, but I always feel odd ""reviewing"" literary classics. It's like, come on, does this book really need my seal of approval? Does anyone really give a ""care"" about what I think of a canonized and immortalized work of art? So maybe that's why when I review a ""classic"" it reads more like a journal entry than an actual review.In The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald touches on a number of tropes that are frequently explored in high school classrooms such as the legitimacy of the American dream, economic stratification, and societal norms of the 1920s. But really what The Great Gatsby leaves its readers with is a profound melancholy, especially if they're over thirty, that their best is behind them. The ethereal visions and dreams of our forgone past loves and accomplishments float farther away as we try to frantically swim closer to them. American society itself is presented a degrading middle aged country without imagination that worships at the alter of capitalism and semi-monarchal familial reputations trapped in a cycle of womb envy.Fitzgerald paints a stark contrast between the painfully normal Nick Carraway, an aimless and listless product of the status quo, and Jay Gatsby's Byronic archetype who tries to fit into a world he can never fully understand. And why should he even try to understand such a broken and disingenuous system? Jay Gatsby unintentionally parodies the society's predilections with his lavish lifestyle and wild parties both meant to ultimately impress his lost love. Between Gatsby and Daisy Jay or Buchanan, the reader can only assume that two people so beautiful, genuine, and innocent being united would be far too much for the degenerating Long Island Hedonists to bear.So is The Great Gatsby worth reading?

maybe that s why when i review a classic it reads more like a journal entry than an actual review in the great gatsby f scott fitzgerald touches on a number of tropes that are frequently explored in high school classrooms such as the legitimacy of the american dream economic stratification and societal norms of the 1920s but really what the great gatsby leaves its readers with is a profound melancholy especially if they re over thirty that their best is behind them the ethereal visions and dreams of our forgone past loves and accomplishments float farther away as we try to frantically swim closer to them american society itself is presented a degrading middle aged country without imagination that worships at the alter of capitalism and semi monarchal familial reputations trapped in a cycle of womb envy fitzgerald paints a stark contrast between the painfully normal nick carraway an aimless and listless product of the status quo and jay gatsby s byronic archetype who tries to fit into a world he can never fully understand and why should he even try to understand such a broken and disingenuous system jay gatsby unintentionally parodies the society s predilections with his lavish lifestyle and wild parties both meant to ultimately impress his lost love between gatsby and daisy jay or buchanan the reader can only assume that two people so beautiful genuine and innocent being united would be far too much for the degenerating long island hedonists to bear so is the great gatsby worth reading don t ask me ,"['a', 'cultural', 'touchstone', 'regardless', 'of', 'quality',

positive,"F.Scott Fitzgerald---The Great!. Mr. F. Scott Fitzgerald is an exceptional writer. Always has been---always will be. There is no other Fitzgerald. In many ways, the same can be said of The Great Gatsby. It is an hauntingly beautiful novel. Yet, it is a very sad novel. For, it reveals the fickle nature---of the human race. In the beginning, Mr. Gatsby is greatly taken with Miss Daisy. Yet,---what he neglects to realize is the fact that the attention that Miss Daisy is projecting towards him---is simply a form of self admiration, whereby---she is the center of attention: Almost as if, she is standing in the midst of a chamber full of mirrors. The surrounding mirrors are the men which are encircling her: Projecting back to her the great and beautiful image of herself. She sees it,---reflected in their eyes. She feels it,---reflected in their mannerism. Mr. Gatsby is but one of the many admirers---just one of the mirrors. Yet, for the moment, that image which he projects back to her is the one which is the most pleasing to her---that is,---for the moment. However, sadly, Mr. Gatsby feels as if he is not worthy of her. He walks away---from her, from all that she represents, and all that which---he madly yearns for. For years, he does---whatever he deems to be necessary---in order to rise up to her level of, what he believes to be, her existence. He arrives at a point where he feels that he is now in a position to consider himself her equal. He is now good enough for her. He strives for wealth and power, because he correlates wealth and power---with Miss Daisy Buchanan. Yet, what he fails to understand is that Miss Daisy Buchanan is not good enough for him. He has been faithful to her, but she has not been faithful to him. What he fails to understand is the fact that she is indeed married to the right person---Mr. Tom Buchanan. For, just the way that he is boorish and unkind on the outside,---so is she---in the inside. He is a reflection of her. But, alas, it is well hidden behind the soft looks and the gentle demeanor. Tom Buchanan portrays the physical aspects of the characteristics which they both share---in one way or another. This is why they came together, and this is why they stay together. She is a fickle woman. Yet, she is not weak. She knows exactly as to what she is doing. The destroyed lives of men have no meaning to her as long as the image in the mirror continues to be. It is the image which must survive. At the end, she is just as much responsible for the tragedy. At one point, Mr. Gatsby states, ""Her voice is full of money."" It is as if he is saying---she represents all that I have strived to achieve, and have wanted. Again and again, he tries to prove himself to Daisy---that he is indeed good enough for her, but what he fails to understand is the fact that the quest was not worth it,---because she was not worth it. It is indeed a very sad testament to human nature, yet it is so very true. This is why, this book lives on and on. The world has not changed much. There still exists many a Daisy Buchanans and Tom Buchanans. Sadly,---there are also many Mr. Gatsbys---trying desperately to prove themselves to the fickle Daisys of the world. Human nature has not changed since Mr. Fitzgerald penned this great novel. What Mr. Gatsby fails to understand is the following fact---that his tragic end came to be on the very day---in which he met Miss Daisy Buchanan. For she reflected in the mirror,---the very image---of what he wanted to become.",3504,"f.scott fitzgerald---the great!. mr. f. scott fitzgerald is an exceptional writer. always has been---always will

Prior to reading this, I had heard so much about how The Great Gatsby is this great, classic all-time novel, and after reading it, I am left wondering what am I missing?  I didn’t find anything particularly exceptional about it, and I don’t see why it’s so great.  Not to say this is a bad novel, I just don’t find it extraordinary.  The plot is pretty pedestrian.  Gatsby has attained wealth through illegal means, makes his moves on the love of his life who married a tyrant for money, bad things happen, which ultimately lead to Gatsby’s demise.  Reading further about the novel, it is supposed to be a great representation of the excesses of the time.  Maybe so, but it’s not much better or more representative than a dozen things I have watched or read about the twenties.

positive,"A Warning To Foolish Stooges Every-Which-Where!. Yes, Dear Readers, it is I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, Professor Emeritus of American History. This is, I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, believe a classic of my time. I remember reading this to my biddy those cold midwinter nights oh so long ago. We drank communion wine by the fire-pit and laughed at the foolish government agents as they tried to capture the nefarious rebel, Gatsby. Little did Gatsby know that shortly after, he would be exiled to Darkest India due to the evil government stooges. Alas, I, Professor Emeritus Johnstone, digress.

Many parts of the book involve a man named Nick telling a story that a person writes as he tells it. The book was fairly easy to read except for a few challenging words here and there. The book is a classic so the way people spoke when it was written is different than what we speak. The Great Gatsby is a book about a middle aged man named Jay Gatsby. Jay moved to a house next to a man named Nick, because he wanted to be close to a woman named Daisy. Gatsby and Daisy go back to about five years before when they were in love. Gatsby went to the army and then Daisy married someone else. Everything from there involves lots of parties and something so unexpected that i cannot say and that you will have to read yourself.

positive,"Is Gatsby ""great""?  The book is.... I read Great Gatsby back in Junior High and my only real memories were that it was boring and the characters were unloveable/unredeemable.Finally getting around to re-reading it with more literature behind me, I have a much different take.  While still not a favorite read of mine, I found it more entertaining than I remember and I actually came away engaged in the story and the characters.Reading it this time, I was more distinctly aware of the prohibition era in which these characters were revolving and the extent to which that directed some of their actions.  The drinking/partying took on a new aspect.  It also gave me a greater perception into Gatsby's character and his relation to society as a whole and the society he was trying to 'break into' (Daisy's).There was still plenty of superficiality to the characters...but that doesn't mean these characters are flat.  On the contrary, I saw a lot more depth this time around than in my early teens.  I was very impressed by the way Fitzgerald added so much depth to these characters while at the same time providing them with so little substance.I enjoyed looking more closely at the interactions between Gatsby and Daisy and the way the various relationships worked.  Now that I've actually dated and married, I viewed the relationships in a different light and could better understand the tension, jealousy and hypocritical behavior going on.I would like to have seen more development of the pseudo-relationship between Nick and Jordan, but I think leaving it vague throughout and then ending it abruptly allows for more in-depth thinking than if Nick and Jordan had happily escaped the tragedy surrounding them.I seem to remember there being significant discussion about the East/West geography in my Junior High English class...but reading it this time, I just didn't see that as a main motif.  Sure, we had ""West Egg"" and ""East Egg"" and various New York parties and excursions.  But when you get down to it, the East/West thing didn't work...partly because all of the main characters are just transplanted anyway (they all came from the west/midwest) and partly because the culture around them felt contrived anyway rather than some high culture that would be representative of the ""true culture"" of established Eastern money or whatever.I had forgotten some of the details of the climax and the ending and so was a little taken off guard when everything unraveled.  Parts of the climax scenes felt a little rushed or underdeveloped, but still provided a satisfying turn of events to the story arc, even if the end of the book left me a little unsettled (which is part of the intent, I believe).My initial rating from my Junior High memories was 2 out of 5 stars.  With a more mature perspective on reading and having read a whole lot more and learned a whole lot more, I can give a better rating and say that I can see now why this book is held up as a classic.  It's not the action packed thriller or adventure novel that I may have wanted as a young teenager, but it is a thought provoking and engaging narrative exploring class and relationships in a turbulent world.****4 stars",3185,"is gatsby ""great""?  the book is.... i read great gatsby back in junior high and my only real memories were that it was boring and the characters were

engaging narrative exploring class and relationships in a turbulent world.****4 stars",is gatsby great the book is i read great gatsby back in junior high and my only real memories were that it was boring and the characters were unloveable unredeemable finally getting around to re reading it with more literature behind me i have a much different take while still not a favorite read of mine i found it more entertaining than i remember and i actually came away engaged in the story and the characters reading it this time i was more distinctly aware of the prohibition era in which these characters were revolving and the extent to which that directed some of their actions the drinking partying took on a new aspect it also gave me a greater perception into gatsby s character and his relation to society as a whole and the society he was trying to break into daisy s there was still plenty of superficiality to the characters but that doesn t mean these characters are flat on the contrary i saw a lot more depth this time around than in my early teens i was very impressed by the way fitzgerald added so much depth to these characters while at the same time providing them with so little substance i enjoyed looking more closely at the interactions between gatsby and daisy and the way the various relationships worked now that i ve actually dated and married i viewed the relationships in a different light and could better understand the tension jealousy and hypocritical behavior going on i would like to have seen more development of the pseudo relationship between nick and jordan but i think leaving it vague throughout and then ending it abruptly allows for more in depth thinking than if nick and jordan had happily escaped the tragedy surrounding them i seem to remember there being significant discussion about the east west geography in my junior high english class but reading it this time i just didn t see that as a main motif sure we had west egg and east egg and various new york parties and excursions but when you get down to it the east west thing didn t work partly because all of the main characters are just transplanted anyway they all came from the west midwest and partly because the culture around them felt contrived anyway rather than some high culture that would be representative of the true culture of established eastern money or whatever i had forgotten some of the details of the climax and the ending and so was a little taken off guard when everything unraveled parts of the climax scenes felt a little rushed or underdeveloped but still provided a satisfying turn of events to the story arc even if the end of the book left me a little unsettled which is part of the intent i believe my initial rating from my junior high memories was 2 out of 5 stars with a more mature perspective on reading and having read a whole lot more and learned a whole lot more i can give a better rating and say that i can see now why this book is held up as a classic it s not the action packed thriller or adventure novel that i may have wanted as a young teenager but it is a thought provoking and engaging narrative exploring class and relationships in a turbulent world 4 stars,"['is', 'gatsby', 'great', 'the', 'book', 'is', 'i', 'read', 'great', 'gatsby', 'back', 'in', 'junior', 'high', 'and', 'my', 'only', 'real',

negative,"A story that shows having money, youth and good looks does not always bring happiness. I know this book is considered a classic and is rated highly but I did not like it at all.

positive,Review from a novice 11th grade reader.. I just finished reading this book for honors english class and i actually enjoyed it. I didn't know what to expect so i was really surpised at how good the writing is. I agree with the reviewer who said the genius of this book is not just the story but the meanings hidden within the text. It really is extraordinary writing. You could analyze almost every sentence in this book and find a hidden or alternate meaning. The story wasn't edge of your seat action but it was still very interesting. The book really makes you think Fitzgerald was far ahead of his time. It's a book that deserves its place as one of the greatest American fiction books of all time.

negative,"I'm confused, I thought classics had to be good.. I truly, truly do not understand how and why this book is considered a classic novel. Excluding foreign works that put this book viciously to shame, even for an American novel, this is not an extraordinary achievement. I'll admt, however, that had this been called a short story, I should have more respect for it; but it is considered a novel! one of the greatest novel of all times, one reviewer wrote! Anyone who believes that has never read a single ""great"" book in his or her life. Read ""The Man Who Laughs,"" ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" anything by Chekhov, ""Les Miserables,"" ""War and Peace,"" ""The Magic Mountain,"" ""The Decameron,"" or even ""Pride and Prejudice"" and then come back exclaiming this is ""the perfect novel!"" It is not. It's wretchedly unorganized, sloppy, more shallow than a puddle of water quickly drying in the sun, poorly written, overly ambitious, and in everyway wanting. I was not forced to read this for highschool, I did for enjoyment, and though I found the work enjoyable, it was enjoyable in the way that a movie is enjoyable: a brief moment of delightfulness. ""Long Journey into Night"" had more literary qualities than this, and that's a movie.

negative,"Not a Classic. I read this book thinking I missed something by not reading it going through school.  I didn't.  The premise is decent enough and may have even been more original when he wrote it.  But the fact is he wrote it quickly, across the ocean from his editor (no e-mail or faxes in those days), and the book apparently didn't even get edited appropriately before publication (Fitzgerald was already a success by the time he wrote this).The result is something barely fleshed out beyond your basic plot outline.  This is just the bare bones, no character development, no real insight into what is happening, just a string of events that come to what Fitzgerald must have thought was a shocking conclusion (although you aren't entirely sure how you got there - we don't really know how Daisy made her decision).  The ride is great though.  Page after page of poorly edited text that reads like stream of consciousness, first draft writing as opposed to a finished work.  I swear at least once he used a word that isn't even a word.  It was so unintelligable that in certain editions (before they went back to previous Fitzgerald drafts and corrected the mistake) a simple grammatical error meant that you could think Daisy was pregnant before marrying Tom.  Such a small error actually dramatically changes how you interpret the key plotline of the book.This book actually was not a smashing success upon publication, nor immediately after Fitzgerald's death.  No, it became popular in the 1950s as America became obsessed with class differences and simultaneously fascinated and envious of the wealthy.  This was the first novel in that space by pure happenstance because there wasn't much interest in the subject when Fitzgerald wrote it.  So being first to market in public schools eager to stoke class differences, it was widely used in schools and took off from there.Utterly skippable.

neutral,"Overall Rating: 3 Kit Kat Bars. Jay Gatsby-- Where do I start with poor Gatsby? Was he in love or was he just so driven by a single dream that it ruined him in the end? One thing I know for sure is that Daisy did not deserve him. He was a delightful man-- all politeness and formalities yet at the same time mysterious. Nick says this of Gatsby when they first meet and I think it's an accurate description of Gatsby's character:""He smiled understandingly-- much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four of five times in a life. It faced-- or seemed to face-- the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of that, at your best, you hoped to convey.""One thing said about America is that you can become whatever you want to be if you only work hard enough. Gatsby attains this, granted not honestly, but attain it he does however it is all done for a singular goal: to win Daisy back. The man comes within a fingertips reach only to watch it slide out of his fingers and explode.""The loneliest moment in someone's life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare.""He was an enigma, a man possessed and one doomed from the very beginning.Daisy Buchanan-- I wanted to like Daisy even though she was vain and naive. I saw the beauty in her character-- a woman who treated life as a song. She had a brightness about her that seemed to radiate sunlight and through her naivety she possessed a child like wisdom, which is often quite wise. She says this that struck a chord with me and turned me towards liking her:""I'm glad it's a girl. And I hope she'll be a fool-- that's the best thing a girl can be in this world, a beautiful fool.""However, I can't forgive her for Gatsby. She loved him, I don't deny that but she broke him and had no trouble walking away from the mess. Every time we see Daisy she is clad in white which is a fitting color for her. It portrays all the things that encompass who she is: vain, naive and thoughtless.""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy-- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.""Review of the Story:The story is not one I enjoyed particularly. I know it is the great American novel but I feel that's due to Fitzgerald's prose and not the actual story. The pacing is slow due to the constant back and forth shifts in time, making it hard to follow and honestly it felt like watching a sad story only get more and more sad with each page. It was depressing and not fun to watch play out.Review of the Writing:This. The writing is the reason why I will be recommending this book to everyone! Fitzgerald's prose is beautiful and his ability to weave in symbols and such is a skill envied by many. I particularly love this piece:“Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther.... And one fine morning-- So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”His writing not only translates to today's time but exudes a vibrancy that stands out from other novels. He makes use of his fine skill and touches on several things within his short novel such as the comparison between West and East Egg. East Egg represented the eastern side of the world, the elder part where tradition is praised while West Egg represented the new world on the western side where status and money did not necessarily go hand in hand. Opportunities are what define money, not status. He also uses colors to represent several things also, the main one is the green that symbolizes money and greed. It's amazing how much he packed in this little novel but what's even more amazing is that it never once overwhelms you.Rating:While I didn't completely fall in love with this novel I have to recommend it purely for the sake of exposing you all to F. Scott Fitzgerald's writing. His beautiful prose is one that will resonate with you and leave you in awe.

him in the end one thing i know for sure is that daisy did not deserve him he was a delightful man all politeness and formalities yet at the same time mysterious nick says this of gatsby when they first meet and i think it s an accurate description of gatsby s character he smiled understandingly much more than understandingly it was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it that you may come across four of five times in a life it faced or seemed to face the whole eternal world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor it understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of that at your best you hoped to convey one thing said about america is that you can become whatever you want to be if you only work hard enough gatsby attains this granted not honestly but attain it he does however it is all done for a singular goal to win daisy back the man comes within a fingertips reach only to watch it slide out of his fingers and explode the loneliest moment in someone s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart and all they can do is stare he was an enigma a man possessed and one doomed from the very beginning daisy buchanan i wanted to like daisy even though she was vain and naive i saw the beauty in her character a woman who treated life as a song she had a brightness about her that seemed to radiate sunlight and through her naivety she possessed a child like wisdom which is often quite wise she says this that struck a chord with me and turned me towards liking her i m glad it s a girl and i hope she ll be a fool that s the best thing a girl can be in this world a beautiful fool however i can t forgive her for gatsby she loved him i don t deny that but she broke him and had no trouble walking away from the mess every time we see daisy she is clad in white which is a fitting color for her it portrays all the things that encompass who she is vain naive and thoughtless they were careless people tom and daisy they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together and let other people clean up the mess they had made review of the story the story is not one i enjoyed particularly i know it is the great american novel but i feel that s due to fitzgerald s prose and not the actual story the pacing is slow due to the constant back and forth shifts in time making it hard to follow and honestly it felt like watching a sad story only get more and more sad with each page it was depressing and not fun to watch play out review of the writing this the writing is the reason why i will be recommending this book to everyone fitzgerald s prose is beautiful and his ability to weave in symbols and such is a skill envied by many i particularly love this piece gatsby believed in the green light the orgastic future that year by year recedes before us it eluded us then but that s no matter tomorrow we will run faster stretch out our arms farther and one fine morning so we beat on boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past his writing not only translates to today s time but exudes a vibrancy that stands out from other novels he makes use of his fine skill and touches on several things within his short novel such as the comparison between west and east egg east egg represented the eastern side of the world the elder part where tradition is praised while west egg represented the new world on the western side where status and money did not necessarily go hand in hand opportunities are what define money not status he also uses colors to represent several things also the main one is the green that symbolizes money and greed it s amazing how much he packed in this little novel but what s even more amazing is that it never once overwhelms you rating while i didn t completely fall in love with this novel i have to recommend it purely for the sake of exposing you all to f scott fitzgerald s writing his beautiful prose is one that will resonate with you and leave you in awe read the great gatsby and get lost in the words ,"['overall', 'rating', '3', 'kit', 'kat', 'bars', 'jay', 'gatsby', 'where', 'do', 'i', 'start',

positive,"Tarnished Waste Land. The Great Gatsby is F. Scott Fitzgerald’s take on what can happen to unrequited love and the American Dream once it becomes an obsession. He tells the story through the eyes of Nick Carroway, the astute narrator who takes us into the heart of the Jazz Age when the Twenties were just starting to roar. The so-called “Lost Generation” had just limped home from World War I and a shattered Europe. They were ripe for self-annihilation.Nick Carroway seems to be the only person in the book who’s on the level. The contrast between his earnestness and the duplicity of the others is ominous and becomes painfully so as the plot thickens. Jay Gatsby’s mysterious extravagance and glamorous lifestyle appear to be a rich man’s generosity to all of New York. But it’s really a labor of love for Daisy Miller, the poor little rich girl whose life is being crushed on the other side of Long Island Sound by old money and her marriage to Tom Buchanan (instead of to Gatsby five years earlier). It was a wrong move on her part but now she has a daughter by Tom, a man used to getting what he wants—and a sexy mistress on the side who just happens to be a married woman.The whole situation is a tawdry, awkward, unsavory calamity of bruised emotions, abused flesh, and damned souls. But Fitzgerald seems to be saying something about America in 1922—a newly rich America careening toward self-destruction as its wasteful materialism is driving everyone to heights of excess never before seen.It was a new thing then. The money was spreading out, trickling down, as they say, into the hands of chauffeurs, butlers, showgirls, mistresses, hangers-on and so forth as the Tom Buchanans and Jay Gatsbys were flaunting their wealth, taking their place in the eyes of the world, living large and making their mark.Again, the complete lack of honesty amid the cacophony of lies and deceit that the participants visit upon one another throughout the novel builds like the screech of an air raid siren that blows on and on, growing louder by the minute. All of the principal characters seem blissfully unaware of their self-inflicted tragedy. It’s as if they play into the hands of the devil, again and again, whether rich or poor. After a while even the truth can’t set them free. They have lived the lie so long that when they finally do cough up the truth it’s too late.Of course, it’s easy to say that we should move on when things don’t work out, but Gatsby is seeking to regain his first love, arguably life’s sweetest delight. Usually, when that’s lost, our dreams won’t let us forget. And Gatsby seems willing to risk everything to steal Daisy Miller away from her lawful husband like some knight in shining armor rescuing a damsel in distress.Not only is Fitzgerald’s mastery of language on display throughout the novel, the complexity of his troubled characters and the realism he brings to them – and how he does it – is spellbinding. The interactions between each character and their dialogue reads like a finely scripted play. There are interludes of despicable malevolence as well as displays of surprising decency. They rudely interrupt each other, say startling things that intensify the drama like the thrust of a sabre, then react as impulsively as you might expect, giving the novel the harrowing tempo of a boiling pot teetering on a red hot stove.What the novel teaches us about life and people in any age is invaluable. Honesty, integrity, and courage are rare, but they certainly do exist. Vain hopes and impossible dreams abound, only to be shattered all too often by the cruelty of fate. Fortune favors the bold and the beautiful, but money (or even looks) can’t buy happiness and poverty can’t either. Meanwhile, life’s blessings are unevenly distributed. And the gigantic blue eyes of Doctor T.J. Eckleburg, gazing out from a faded billboard like the eyes of God, are watching over all the world in the “valley of ashes,” silently judging the affairs of the human heart, separating the sheep from the goats, the sacred from the profane, the beloved from the damned, and with malice toward none.The Great Gatsby may be a short book, but it packs a powerful punch.

neutral,"Short and Sweet. `The Great Gatsby' is a novel that attempts to probe into the heart of the American Dream. Implicit in its portrayal of the subject, the novel uncovers the pragmatism and the callous indifference that characterize the thinking of the individuals of the society then. Through the lucid writing of F. Scott Fitzgerald, we see the lofty ambitions of Gatsby and Daisy being played out. Gatsby, in order to get close to Daisy and propel himself to a higher social stratum, lied to her about his background. Daisy, on the other hand, took to Gatsby because of his stint at Oxford. The American society of the 1920s saw a steady rise in prosperity of the nation and the standard of the living of the people. It was a period of hedonism and extravagance, with the Americans `believing in the green light' and striving to `run faster, stretch out their arms farther' to reach out for their `orgastic future'.The novel is short and sweet, but it did not resonate very well with me.

positive,"Cameron Harvey The Great Gatsby Review Overall. Cameron Harvey  The Great Gatsby ReviewOverall, I really enjoyed reading The Great Gatsby. I found it to be a very entertaining book about very interesting characters. The book could be very well described to be a commentary on the extravagant lives in which people lived, during a very economically prosperous time in the 1920s, in addition to a number of societal issues present during Fitzgerald’s time period.  These issues include heavy alcohol use during a time when drinking was actually legal due to prohibition. In addition to these over the top social activities, there’s considerable mention of the extravagance that those with acquisition of recent wealth demonstrate through  superficial showings of wealth. Fitzgerald offers his commentary on these throughout the book.However, there is some reason to wonder whether Fitzgerald is a critic or a participant in the life of Gatsby. This really adds to the quality of the book. Jay Gatsby as a character has much in common with Fitzgerald’s own life and goals.  Fitzgerald was fond of writing about the rich. In fact, in another story he wrote,  (the Rich Boy, 1926) he actually started the story with one of his most famous quotes:''Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me”.Fitzgerald’s own life involved a steady fascination with wealth. He was descended from a famous family whose family fortunes were comfortable, but not rich. His wife’s family was reluctant to have him marry her because of his financial situation. He envied his Princeton friends whose families had more money. He and Zelda spent wildly while living in New York, forcing him to write short stories and borrow money from his literary agent.Gatsby as a rich and tragic figure parallels Fitzgerald’s goals and his future life story. When he was a young man, he would introduce himself as “F Scott Fitzgerald, the well-known alcoholic”1, and he knew that his life would not be long.  Jay and Daisy have many parallels to Scott and Zelda, including the long pursuit and the short time together afterward.  Jay and Daisy lasted only day and Scott and Zelda had a short life together because of her mental illness and his alcoholism.  The strongest part of this book is the character development, as I see it.  Fitzgerald was able to develop them so well because he basically knew them and lived them. More so than many books I have read before, by the end of this book I knew Jay and I knew Daisy and I also knew what the end of the story would turn out to be. It is no surprise that this book is seen, long after Fitzgerald’s death, as his best work. It captures the tragedy of the time and of the writer himself.1.  Goodwin DW The Alcoholism of F.

positive,"It's Not About the Parties. It's not just about the parties.Everything about Jay Gatsby's world is theater - the mansion; the wealth; the parties; the pedigree; the affectation of an ""old sport"" English accent; and even the circumstances leading to his ultimate demise. His life is a private Potemkin affair with a singular goal: to rekindle a lost love.Gatsby barely even attended those Long Island extravaganzas he hosted every Saturday night in that summer of 1922. Think of them  more as theater with an audience of one - an audience of one, that is, only in the off chance that maybe,  just maybe,  Daisy Buchanen (now married: details, details) might actually show up and be impressed.  Talk about your chick magnet.We might enjoy The Great Gatsby on a number of levels. In its most base and literal incarnation, we could get lost in the trappings of our own Highland Gatsby event and roll around in snob chic. On this night, this one night, we'd gather and preen and seduce one another  with our chosen area of expertise (choose: wine; food; books; carbon footprint; Ming dynasty furniture; our swell vacation in Hoboken) while we snub and sniff and sneer at those who don't share our pretensions.The only role already assigned in the faux-Gatsby event would be that of Nick Carraway, the reserved mid-Western transplant who, as both Gatsby's new neighbor and Daisy's cousin, has a unique perspective on this would-be mating dance and serves as the novel's narrator. Yes, that role is mine -  that's me, the reserved one, standing over there alone at the drink table looking vaguely lost.A deeper reading of the novel, however, would invite our attention to that elusive, wonderful, suck-the-oxygen-out-of-the-room curse called love. Or obsession.How bad can it get? Let's put it this way. Gatsby bought that mega-mansion on the West Egg  (the nouveau riche) island for the sole reason that it provided an unobstructed view of  the green light marking the end of Daisy's dock over there on the East Egg (old money) island. The Green Light. He'd stare. Longingly. Fantasize. Stare. The Green Light.We've taken a run at the obsession topic before. Our Lolita discussion (9/11/06) was all about this phenomenon of  ""love, marked by a fierceness that so often destroys adult lives.""  That sex-laced road trip may be closer to what we might label today as pathology given it involved  a middle-age man and twelve-year-old Lolita but both stories seem to share the same tune.One common question: the distinction between the power of the illusion versus the worthiness of the underlying object.  Neither Daisy nor Lolita would seem to the ""objective"" reader to be worthy of the bestowed adoration. No matter. The illusion transcends the subject. Even an oil slick is iridescent when the light strikes it right. The light then shifts and yet another Country Western song is born.Or we can take Gatsby as allegory. The American dream - originally all about discovery, individualism, and the pursuit of happiness (per Nick Carraway's meditation) - becomes corrupted by rampant materialism just as Gatsby's dream of idealized love (when dreams had meaning) crumbles with the unworthiness of its object (America, as Daisy, devolves into Material Girl).Those who would write the novel off as simply good riddance to a bygone gilded era of wretched excess would do well to read the article, ""Gatsby's Green Light Beckons a New Set of Strivers"" (NYT, 2/18/08). The novel is now required reading at half the high schools in the country and resonates powerfully among urban adolescents, many of them first- and second-generation immigrants who are striving to ascend in 21st-century America.Take particular note of the reflections of Susan Morris, director of the English program at Boston Latin and who has been teaching Gatsby for 32 years, ""They all understand what it is to strive for something . . . to want to be someone you're not, to want to achieve something that's just beyond reach, whether it's professional success or wealth or idealized love - or a 4.0 or admission to Harvard.""

be that of nick carraway the reserved mid western transplant who as both gatsby s new neighbor and daisy s cousin has a unique perspective on this would be mating dance and serves as the novel s narrator yes that role is mine that s me the reserved one standing over there alone at the drink table looking vaguely lost a deeper reading of the novel however would invite our attention to that elusive wonderful suck the oxygen out of the room curse called love or obsession how bad can it get let s put it this way gatsby bought that mega mansion on the west egg the nouveau riche island for the sole reason that it provided an unobstructed view of the green light marking the end of daisy s dock over there on the east egg old money island the green light he d stare longingly fantasize stare the green light we ve taken a run at the obsession topic before our lolita discussion 9 11 06 was all about this phenomenon of love marked by a fierceness that so often destroys adult lives that sex laced road trip may be closer to what we might label today as pathology given it involved a middle age man and twelve year old lolita but both stories seem to share the same tune one common question the distinction between the power of the illusion versus the worthiness of the underlying object neither daisy nor lolita would seem to the objective reader to be worthy of the bestowed adoration no matter the illusion transcends the subject even an oil slick is iridescent when the light strikes it right the light then shifts and yet another country western song is born or we can take gatsby as allegory the american dream originally all about discovery individualism and the pursuit of happiness per nick carraway s meditation becomes corrupted by rampant materialism just as gatsby s dream of idealized love when dreams had meaning crumbles with the unworthiness of its object america as daisy devolves into material girl those who would write the novel off as simply good riddance to a bygone gilded era of wretched excess would do well to read the article gatsby s green light beckons a new set of strivers nyt 2 18 08 the novel is now required reading at half the high schools in the country and resonates powerfully among urban adolescents many of them first and second generation immigrants who are striving to ascend in 21st century america take particular note of the reflections of susan morris director of the english program at boston latin and who has been teaching gatsby for 32 years they all understand what it is to strive for something to want to be someone you re not to want to achieve something that s just beyond reach whether it s professional success or wealth or idealized love or a 4 0 or admission to harvard or to paraphrase an old perfume

positive,"Prose transformed into poetry. There are over 6000 reviews of ""The Great Gatsby"" on Amazon, so I'll be brief.  At 66 I decided I should read what is widely acclaimed as the ""Greatest American Novel.""  I did.

positive,"A modern classic!. I had read The Great Gatsby for the first time in high school, and if I didn't have to read it again in college, I would've said: it's over-rated, it's boring..blah blah, I didn't know how to read literature! I strongly believe that everyone who rated this classic novel below a 3 stars didn't fully grasp the symbolism in the characters, the location (East/West Egg, Dr. T's Eyes), the green light or the meaning of any of the relationships. It's a really quick read, 180 pages, you can do it in one day...but read with much concentration! Go back to your college days and remember that legendary authors, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, crafts his work so that NOTHING is written by mistake. The setting, the colors, the dialogue, they all have an underlying meaning.I would also recommend reading a little biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald before reading ""The Great Gatsby,"" because then you'll know that it's somewhat autobiographical, being that he is from the Midwest and he was a solider.Overall, reading The Great Gatsby requires immense concentration and an understanding of literature/symbolism.

positive,"Gatsby is great. By some quirk in my personal history, I'd never read GATSBY. It has many beautifully written, poetic passages, and Gatsby's demise retains an ineffable sadness that moved me in the final pages. The absence of mourners at his funeral was particularly poignant. Fitzgerald's theme of pursuing an incompletely realized dream is universal, with the corollary that if one's timing is off, the dream may forever remain out of reach. Add to this a crushing irony: in order to win Daisy, Gatsby strove to make himself a member of her wealthy Long Island society, but she is shallow and frivolous and her husband is brutish and racist. The others in their group show no loyalty to Gatsby, the man who'd thrown them lavish parties, by deserting him in death.I'll comment briefly on the poetic nature of Fitzgerald's prose. He uses two metaphors involving water that are linked inextricably to the action of the novel. At the beginning of the story, the narrator, Nick, notes that ""Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the wet marshes..."" comparing conduct to an edifice that can be built on a solid base (""hard rock"") or a tenuous one (""wet marshes""). Foreshadowing is at work here as Gatsby's springboard into affluent society turns out to be a yacht in a dangerously shallow mooring. Unfortunately, Gatsby is floating in his pool at the end when he is shot to death. The novel concludes with another ""wet"" metaphor in the justly famous line ""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."" Humans are boats struggling to row into the future, while all the while carried backward by Time's river. Figures of speech are only effective if they complement the surrounding language and action.Another vivid display of language occurs at the beginning of Chapter III with a 2 1/2 page description of the preparations for and beginning of a typical Gatsby party. ""On buffet tables, garnished with glistening hors d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of harlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark gold."" Later, the narrator notes, ""The bar is in full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden outside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual innuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic meetings between women who never knew each other's names.""

neutral,"flawed novel. I know that lots of people consider this the Great American Novel, but to me it's too flawed to rank that high.The problems begin with the decision to have the story narrated by Nick, a minor character.  The first page of the story is devoted to Fitzgerald's trying to convince the reader that Nick is a reliable narrator (""I'm inclined to reserve all judgements"" -- how many people go around saying things like that, and would you believe them if they did?).  For the rest of the story he has to arrange for Nick to be everybody's confidante and present at all the crucial scenes, even when his friends are committing adultery: he's there when Gatsby shows his girlfriend his shirt collection; he's there when Tom punches HIS girlfriend in the nose; he's there at the fatal auto accident, and it's awkward that he's not there when Gatsby gets shot.Then there are the story's underlying assumptions.  Fitzgerald assumes that his (1930 WASP) audience will favor the old-rich Buchanans and dislike the newly-rich Gatsby, then tries to convince them otherwise.  If you don't have that bias in the first place, a lot of the novel is a waste.  And Fitzgerald doesn't seem to realize that Nick is old-boy-network too -- his bond-selling job is apparently so easy that he hardly ever mentions it.Then there's the 1930s racism.  To present a really contemptuous picutre of the New Rich, he describes a car of rich African-Americans.  And to hint at Gatsby's shady background, Fitzgerald brings in a Jewish racketeer  (who, of course, describes his scams to Nick in detail - see paragraph 2).The purpose of all this is to teach Nick something -- that rich people can be jerks, I guess.  Not that Nick does anything with the lesson, except write the novel.",1760,"flawed novel. i know that lots of people consider this the great american novel, but to me it's too flawed to rank that

flaw to rank that high the problem begin with the decis to have the stori narrat by nick a minor charact the first page of the stori is devot to fitzgerald s tri to convinc the reader that nick is a reliabl narrat i m inclin to reserv all judgement how mani peopl go around say thing like that and would you believ them if they did for the rest of the stori he ha to arrang for nick to be everybodi s confidant and present at all the crucial scene even when hi friend are commit adulteri he s there when gatsbi show hi girlfriend hi shirt collect he s there when tom punch hi girlfriend in the nose he s there at the fatal auto accid and it s awkward that he s not there when gatsbi get shot then there are the stori s underli assumpt fitzgerald assum that hi 1930 wasp audienc will favor the old rich buchanan and dislik the newli rich gatsbi then tri to convinc them otherwis if you don t have that bia in the first place a lot of the novel is a wast and fitzgerald doesn t seem to realiz that nick is old boy network too hi bond sell job is appar so easi that he hardli ever mention it then there s the 1930 racism to present a realli contemptu picutr of the new rich he describ a car of rich african american and to hint at gatsbi s shadi background fitzgerald bring in a jewish racket who of cours describ hi scam to nick in detail see paragraph 2 the purpos of all thi is to teach nick

positive,"The Great Gatsby. The Great Gatsby is a very suspenseful and interesting book.  There are many twists to the plot and a lot of unexpected events.  I found myself very surprised throughout the book because of the dramatic changes in the plot. The characters in the book were very interesting people.  My favorite was Gatsby because of his unusual way of doing things.  He would have parties and not go to them.  This was the most odd thing about him in my opinion.  It was also weird how he could keep his love for Daisy over all the years.  Daisy was a very emotional character and I didn't like her very much for that.  She was always unhappy about something during the book.  When everything seemed alright and when she seemed happy something would upset her.  I found this sort of annoying and that is why I didn't like Daisy as a character.  Nick was a fairly shy character and he was my second favorite.  He always went along with what was happening and never caused too many problems.  He was very down to earth and I like that about him. The setting seemed very old fashioned to me.  Gatsby's Mansion seemed to be very cool though, almost like a castle.  I liked his mansion and the basic setting of the book. The plot was my favorite out of all.  I was very bored throughout the book until the end.  This is where it went 180 degrees and everything fell apart.  I loved when Gatsby and Tom got into a fight because it staged the killing of Myrtle.  This put some spice into the book and I was suddenly interested.  George then thought that Gatsby had hit and killed his wife.  When George came down to Gatsby's house it was very suspenseful.  I liked when George shot Gatsby and then committed suicide. Overall I liked this book a lot.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in reading it.

I won't repeat any of the previous rave reviews, but I will make a couple of suggestions for those struggling with this book.First, I've taught this book over 20 times, and find that with proper guidance most students can at least see the artistic mastery, if not appreciate the text.Second, if you are having difficulty with the text, try to draw some of the key scenes.  Yes, sit down with a blank sheet of paper, and a box of crayons and sketch the following scenes: chapter one when Daisy and Jordan are sitting among the French windows, chapter two with the description of the Valley of the Ashes, and chapter three with the description of Gatsby's house.  As you read continue to notice the way that colors and sunlight play a dominate role in the book.Third, read chapter 7 in one stretch and if possible assign roles to each speaker.  I argue that this chapter is pretty much self-contained and could be considered a novella within the novel.  There is more action, irony, and plain literary fun in these 50 odd pages than most longer novels.Fourth, if you still don't get the novel, AND if you are being forced to read this book for high school English, pick it up again once you turn 30 and have had life jade you a bit.

positive,"An American Classic with numerous layers and implications.. I finished reading this book for the first time last week. I usually review the books I read here, but since this book is closing in on being 100 years old, is required reading in many American AP high school English courses and most likely everything that could possibly be said about it by the human race, positive and negative, has been said by reviewers of higher importance than I, I thought it would be silly to review it.But here's this: I liked it. I liked it quite a lot. As much as I read, it's almost absurd that I hadn't gotten to this one sooner, but I'm glad I read it at this age because I almost surely wouldn't have appreciated it in it's fullness if I'd read it in high school.My wife recently read it for the second time (and she loves it), and though our taste in books is usually pretty far from similar, she insisted I really ought to give it a whirl. I was in the mood for something older and in the modern classic realm, so here we are.I have to say it went by fast. I mean, it's a short novel; less than 200 pages. But I daresay once things get cooking (once Gatsby actually enters the novel, basically), it's almost written in a jumpy, quick-moving way. Sure, there are moments of quiet beauty and reminiscence, but the party scenes are perfect depictions of swirling chaos from loud-mouthed, gossipy rich people from the perspective of a man who largely keeps to himself. I love how well the tone of the dialogue encapsulates the time period and suggests that most of the folks were talking just to hear their own voices, responding with answers that had nothing to do with the previous speaker, and no one really listened and no one really cared (again I'm referring primarily to the rich folks at the parties... not necessarily Gatsby or the other main characters, though Daisy shows some hints of this high-living arrogance).This is getting dangerously close to a review (MAY IT NEVER BE, GAINES!!), so I'll wrap up. I reckon this is a novel with layers; something short and rich that reveals more good stuff every time you re-read it.

usual review the book i read here but sinc thi book is close in on be 100 year old is requir read in mani american ap high school english cours and most like everyth that could possibl be said about it by the human race posit and neg ha been said by review of higher import than i i thought it would be silli to review it but here s thi i like it i like it quit a lot as much as i read it s almost absurd that i hadn t gotten to thi one sooner but i m glad i read it at thi age becaus i almost sure wouldn t have appreci it in it s full if i d read it in high school my wife recent read it for the second time and she love it and though our tast in book is usual pretti far from similar she insist i realli ought to give it a whirl i wa in the mood for someth older and in the modern classic realm so here we are i have to say it went by fast i mean it s a short novel less than 200 page but i daresay onc thing get cook onc gatsbi actual enter the novel basic it s almost written in a jumpi quick move way sure there are moment of quiet beauti and reminisc but the parti scene are perfect depict of swirl chao from loud mouth gossipi rich peopl from the perspect of a man who larg keep to himself i love how well the tone of the dialogu encapsul the time period and suggest that most of the folk were talk just to hear their own voic respond with answer that had noth to do with the previou speaker and no one realli listen and no one realli care again i m refer primarili to the rich folk at the parti not necessarili gatsbi or the other main charact though daisi show some hint of thi high

positive,"It's a great book with plenty of symbolism. It's a great book with plenty of symbolism. If you take the time to read it, you'll definitely enjoy it.

positive,"Four for Gatsby. I would give ""The Great Gatsby"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald four stars. The book was on the shorter side so it didn't take that long to read. My favorite thing about the book was the character development and how the characters interacted with one another. Nick, the narrator, is the only character not obsessed with wealth and societal titles. I liked that he was the only really genuine character seen throughout the novel because I was able to understand his thoughts and point of view when it came to other people in the society. Nick's relationship with each character was different and complex. I also thought that Jay Gatsby was developed in such a way where the reader was able to really learn about him but he was also able to remain mysterious which was fascinating to read. The book was not boring either, it had surprising moments and plot twists; which I enjoyed. I would've given this book five stars if it didn't have such large amounts of description.

positive,"Tragic love triangle. Fitzgerald's masterpiece stands the test of time. The decadence and callousness of the characters make them hard to like, but riveting as well.

positive,"A very powerful American tragedy. I read this book in high school, and I loved the prose. Fitzgerald paints really amazing pictures with his words.However, this book was much more powerful when I read it again as an adult. For me, the theme of the book was that you can't escape your past, and you have to be careful what you wish for in your future. It really drives home the point that you can't depend on other people for your happiness. You just don't know when one of those solid people that you trust turns out to be one of the shallow people instead.This book is a tragedy, and it seems more powerful than the Greek tragedies I've read. In Greek tragedy, so much of what happens seems to happen as a whim of the gods and there is nothing anyone can do to escape their fate. Fate takes control for Gatsby, but he doesn't have the gods to blame. It makes it a much more tragic story.I strongly recommend reading this book, even if (or maybe especially if) you've read it before. It's a much more powerful book to read once you've been in the position to have lost some of your dreams, to see the shallowness of the real world outside of high school or college.",1165,"a very

The beholder of the secret, or the individual the secret it about? Nick is in this wedge of secrets as the book progresses. The way F. Scott Fitzgerald mixes the characters lives together is by itself amazing, but then he adds the colour of the twenties and the parties and Gatsby. He uses thorough imagery to portray Jay Gatsby’s carefree, expensive life. The novel ends with a decision: Gatsby or Tom Buchanan?

positive,"Boundless. I firmly believe that ""The Great Gatsby"" is a novel that cannot be fully appreciated in a first read. I read it for the first time after college, and hated it. Now, 10 years later I have read it half a dozen times, and find it to be a richer and richer experience every time.Fitzgerald was a talented writer, and there are times that the prose in this text is breathtakingly good. But that is not what makes this novel stand out as one of the greatest pieces of truly American literature. Rather it is the eternal optimism, sometimes misplaced, of Gatsby (and some of the other characters) that keeps calling to the reader long after the last page. Fitzgerald wrote a book that speaks to the American ideals and persona, and he did it in the guise of a love story. There is no better description of the indefatigable American spirit than the last page of this novel. It is literary perfection, and even if the book that preceded it was not incredible it would be worth the price.I won't rehash plot points here, but I will say that in Gatsby, Daisy, Jordan Baker, and the amazingly well drawn Tom Buchanan, Fitzgerald created a cast of characters that will long reign as one of the most recognizable in the canon of American Lit. I recently reread this novel for a book club, and it is no coincidence that despite the many varied reactions to the book, everyone agreed that Tom stood out. We all knew a Tom in our lives. It speaks to Fitzgerald's honesty as a writer that one of the least likable characters in the text is one of the novel's standouts.Don't read ""The Great Gatsby"" because you have to. Read it because you want to. And then put it aside and live a few more years of life. Then come back to it. You will be amazed what you will find in its pages that you did not find before.",1802,"boundless. i firmly believe that ""the great gatsby"" is a novel that cannot be fully appreciated in a first

appreciated in a first read i read it for the first time after college and hated it now 10 years later i have read it half a dozen times and find it to be a richer and richer experience every time fitzgerald was a talented writer and there are times that the prose in this text is breathtakingly good but that is not what makes this novel stand out as one of the greatest pieces of truly american literature rather it is the eternal optimism sometimes misplaced of gatsby and some of the other characters that keeps calling to the reader long after the last page fitzgerald wrote a book that speaks to the american ideals and persona and he did it in the guise of a love story there is no better description of the indefatigable american spirit than the last page of this novel it is literary perfection and even if the book that preceded it was not incredible it would be worth the price i won t rehash plot points here but i will say that in gatsby daisy jordan baker and the amazingly well drawn tom buchanan fitzgerald created a cast of characters that will long reign as one of the most recognizable in the canon of american lit i recently reread this novel for a book club and it is no coincidence that despite the many varied reactions to the book everyone agreed that tom stood out we all knew a tom in our lives it speaks to fitzgerald s honesty as a writer that one of the least likable characters in the text is one of the novel s standouts don t read the great gatsby because you have to read it because you want to and then put it aside and live a few more years of life then come back to it you will be amazed what you will find in its pages that you did not find before ,"['boundless', 'i', 'firmly', 'believe', 'that', 'the', 'great', 'gatsby', 'is', 'a', 'novel', 'that',

positive,"A good book to read!. In 1922 during the jazz age, F. Scott Fitzgerald brings forth an extra ordinary tale of love. Fitzgerald was made to write a smooth and entertaining novel such as, The Great Gatsby, which became a classic of the twentieth century literature. F. Scott Fitzgerald  carefully selects his characters' words as he describes the astounding and fabulously wealthy Jay Gatsby and his strong, innocent intentions as he strives to exalt his love to the beautiful Daisy Buchanan. The Great Gatsby is a tragedy amongst the wealthy and the poor. It is irresistibly melancholy but funny, while  light but sensible from beginning to the end.The story depicts Gatsby's obsession with his one true love, Daisy, whether he was right or wrong to love her, his love for her robs life of all its meaning and purpose. Fitzgerald writes a phenomenal novel, that without a doubt, can be called a masterpiece. His choice of words is very articulate and the description he embodies in every sentence is pleasurable for all readers. Fitzgerald helps the reader to become a part of the novel and connect with the characters. He writes to make his readers be aware of their imaginations, while making them picture the narration perfectly down to the very last detail. Fitzgerald creates fictional characters, such as Gatsby that one can fascinate to and enjoy reading about. This novel is hard to put down, its very easy flowing once you start you just have to finish it!. The book is so dramatic and entertaining that it's easy to miss the fact that it's beautifully written.A work to remember, for I usually have trouble connecting with other books I read for Literature class. The Great Gatsby was such a breakthrough, and a good attempt to get my fascination of dramatic, and suspenseful novels into place. I highly suggest for anyone who would like to read a dreamy, classy, and an outstanding story to pick up The Great Gatsby. The story gives a new thrill of a Shakespearean story ""Romeo and Juliet,"" with a sensational twist at the end. It proves that not every love story ends beautifully, or the way the main character would like it to, which makes Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby an even more sophisticated and like no other. This story is not like your average ""love story"", it gives away more than you expect. And that clearly shows how an author develops his master piece as he progresses with his writing. I am sure that many young adult readers that come across The Great Gatsby will surely enjoy reading it. It is surely a dramatic novel at it's best!",2559,"a good book to read!. in 1922 during the jazz age, f. scott fitzgerald brings forth an extra ordinary tale of love. fitzgerald was made to write a

negative,"Not So Great Gatsby. The subjects of the book, The Great Gatsby, are Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchannan. If you are rich and money if no object to you then you would see it as a non-fiction story. But if you are like the majority of other people around the United States, then it would be fiction. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote this ""great"" novel that everyone proclaims it to be, which by some and sometimes many will tell you the opposite. The greatest book ever written in American Literature is just a man (Gatsby) who claims to be in love, but looks to be more obsessed, and is trying to win back his lost love (Daisy). Nick Carraway tells the story in third person. He tells of his summer spent in Long Island, New York with the rich and the richer. Nick describes in a very wordy way how each major event of the summer unraveled and played out. With love, suspense and heartbreak, Nick takes you in and even when you try your best to pull away, you just cannot. It is not so much the book is great as it is addicting. As human beings we are all curious, and one proverb states that curiosity kills the cat. People love drama, and that is what Fitzgerald perfectly describes in his novel. After fulfilling your curiosity with such descriptive and sometimes complicated wording, some might come to realize that there was nothing great about Gatsby all along. Sure the book maybe interesting but that is because people cannot keep their nose out of their own business. People are curious about other relationships and flings and try to dig deeper into them. So just as in the Great Gatsby, you find yourself digging in for more dirt on the romance of Daisy and Jay. Once completing the novel, you can see the resemblance to Jay and other people in the modern world. Mr. Jay Gatsby was the pioneer of rich people who swoon the females with his money. He is not great; he is just a bootlegger and a liar, just like a lot of people you might be familiar with in Hollywood. And Daisy Buchannan, what is there really to love about her? She is a shallow, gold digging swine that seems like she needs a taste of what it feels like to have no money. If you watched the movie like I did, then you'd hope she was poor to begin with.  Jay Gatsby is nothing but a fool in love and Daisy is just a fool in love with money. Nick Carraway, well he is just a fool who cannot keep his nose out of where it doesn't belong. The ending had me wanting more though, wanting to know what in the world just happened. A relationship ended abruptly with no closure, well if this in fact is take from certain events from Fitzgerald's life then I most certainly feel sorry for the many. The end could have been as worded longer and complex just like the rest of the book. But in my opinion Mr. Fitzgerald just got lazy and decided to end the book at that. The Jay Gatsby was as great as claimed to be, then so is everyone who hustles for a women (Donald Trump, me and every other rich non-attractive male with an overly-attractive partner) is great. And if that is true then so be it. I would like to be known as a great person too and have my memory forever etched in the annals of American Literature.",3171,"not so great gatsby. the subjects of the book, the great gatsby, are jay

neutral,"A slight read, nowhere near the quality of greater American novels. It is very difficult to judge The Great Gatsby fairly.  Given its prominence on so many Greatest American Novels lists, one almost cannot help but compare it to the masterwork many have described it as being, rather than evaluating it simply for what it is.  And what it is, is a relatively slight, simple book with occasional (albeit infrequent) flashes of scintillating writing, and a melodramatic plot amid cinematically friendly surroundings.  Some might find it a reasonably entertaining read.  It’s nowhere close in quality to the works of the greatest American writers, such as Faulkner, Wharton, Nabokov (assuming he counts as American) or Melville.It’s hard not to compare Gatsby, unflatteringly, to Edit Wharton’s Age of Innocence. Both novels were published in the 1920s, and both concern the cultural peculiarities of the super-rich.  But there any similarity between the two novels ends.  The characters in Gatsby are one-dimensional: Daisy is a flatly rendered love object, Tom Buchanan is a rich snob and bigot, Gatsby himself an interloping, aspirational romantic.  Meyer Wolfsheim is a Jewish stereotype, horrifying to modern readers’ eyes.  Fitzgerald shows no interesting inner lives to any of these characters – not even Nick, the narrator.  Whereas Wharton details the culture of the New York rich with great nuance, perspective and precision, Fitzgerald’s treatment is pedestrian by comparison.  His characters are archetypes; they never feel real.The themes of Gatsby are ones that must have appealed to English teachers of a certain time: they’re overpoweringly male – focused on money, power, status, fast cars, and the pursuit of women.  The message of the book suits someone who is looking for a cynical take on American society: that the American dream of upward mobility and social acceptance is a mirage, that the super-rich are a bunch of shallow, hedonistic, faithless jerks, that women care only about men’s money, and that the rich expel any outsider who dares to invade their realm.  True or untrue, it’s not a substitute for realistic characters interacting with each other in compelling, substantive ways.I won’t spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that a class conflict is set up, and a melodramatic, implausible climax is contrived, all in relatively short order.The book may be worth reading just to familiarize oneself with certain characters and a plot that many Americans have come to know and to reference.  If nothing else, it’s quite short.  But if you’re looking for the Great American Novel, look elsewhere.",2625,"a slight read, nowhere near the quality of greater american novels. it is very difficult to judge the great gatsby fairly.

Trying to review a classic is always a dramatic thing: the book normally becomes a classic when a lot of high schoolers have dissected the text a bunch of times and are sick of it. Reviewing The Great Gatsby required me to watch the Leonardo DiCaprio movie (what a terrible sacrifice) and read analyses and reviews online to help structure my thoughts.The Great Gatsby is two stories in one: the story of Gatsby and Daisy’s love affair during the roaring twenties, told through the eyes of Nick, and also the story of the decaying American Dream.As a first impression, I liked but didn’t love this novel. I loved its language: the sentences Fitzgerald creates are rather beautifully built and full of symbolism, but I found the characters difficult to understand. I don’t need to relate to a character or to like them in order to enjoy a novel, but with this one I couldn’t always understand the reasons behind some actions, nor completely grasp the personality of each one.It is difficult for me, as a Brazilian living in Europe, to actually speak much for the American Dream theme that is the undertone of this novel.

Her appearance as an unattainable dream, much too distorted by Gatsby’s rosy view of the past for it to be possible for him to reach was thought-provoking, and the fact that she is heavily based upon Zelda Fitzgerald is very interesting! I couldn’t dislike her.

leonardo dicaprio movi what a terribl sacrific and read analys and review onlin to help structur my thought the great gatsbi is two stori in one the stori of gatsbi and daisi s love affair dure the roar twenti told through the eye of nick and also the stori of the decay american dream as a first impress i like but didn t love thi novel i love it languag the sentenc fitzgerald creat are rather beauti built and full of symbol but i found the charact difficult to understand i don t need to relat to a charact or to like them in order to enjoy a novel but with thi one i couldn t alway understand the reason behind some action nor complet grasp the person of each one it is difficult for me as a brazilian live in europ to actual speak much for the american dream theme that is the underton of thi novel i did love it cynic symbol and it got me think of ideal of peopl and of the futur of the decad of moral and charact of privileg and lack thereof i found daisi an incred curiou charact that i fail to fulli understand but wa fascin by nonetheless her appear as an unattain dream much too distort by gatsbi s rosi view of the past for it to be possibl for him to reach wa thought provok and the fact that she is heavili base upon zelda fitzgerald is veri interest i couldn t dislik her gatsbi himself wa someon i had troubl understand too with hi strang way of speak both intens and na ve i do recommend thi novel if you do not mind the slow pace of the first half of the novel which is short in ani case and i recommend the 2013 movi with leonardo dicaprio veri highli i love it so much and it help me understand gatsbi s charact better

neutral,"Somewhat meaningful, yet Overrated. F. Scott Fitzgerald's THE GREAT GATSBY is a somewhat quick read. It is not a diffiuclt read, so it is reasonable to see why so many of us have or will read this work during our high school days.Our story's protagonist, Nick Carroway, is the real focus of the story, despite the book's title. Gatsby is merely the focus of Nick's observations. Beginning as a person of mystique and fascination to our protagonist Nick, Gatsby lives a life of luxary and prestige. Throwing lavish parties and seemingly on the top of the world, Gatsby is merely putting on a show. The lavish lifestyle he displays is meant to represent what can be achieved if you work hard to find the 'American Dream'.

positive,"Great Gatsby Review: Million Words Project. The Great Gatsby was a true representation of the classic plot twist. I fell in love with the movie when I saw it a few weeks ago, but I was skeptical that I would be disappointed in the comparison between the book and the film. To my surprise, they were both very similar, the film bringing the book to life. What I truly enjoyed about the book was the enchantment of the characters. They weren't necessarily personified as magical characters, but as people who have majestic personalities. The way Gatsby himself is such a hidden being for the first chapter of the book is what really kept me reading and engaged with the text. The ending was a bit of turn around, a downfall for the reader. With the way the author set the story up, the reader tends to lean towards a certain character based upon their opinion. In my case, I leaned more towards Gatsby's point of view, mostly because I loved the way he waited so long for his long-lost love. The book is a fantastic read that will keep you up at night trying to finish each chapter!

text the end wa a bit of turn around a downfal for the reader with the way the author set the stori up the reader tend to lean toward a certain charact base upon their opinion in my case i lean more toward gatsbi s point of view mostli becaus i love the way he wait so long for hi long lost love the book is a fantast read that will keep you up at night tri to finish each chapter i d recommend it to anyon from age 15 and up

not written and the hidden subtl mean between the line and the potent reaction of the reader that make thi book one of the classic of american literatur that and fitzgerald s eleg almost danc like symbol and deep prose ye mani might react surprisingli at the word deep to describ the great gatsbi but mani simpli did not see that in portray the shallow of the charact the fast pace 1920 s eastern

mankind should strive for and unfortun what most miss wa clearli point out in the novel as i read other review i conclud that mani misunderstood thi novel and it took a kid review to understand the main theme of the book as we tri to look into the futur be it for our ambit fulfil happi or love and turn our dream into realiti as gatsbi so desper strive for you are forev thrown back into your past that ha been forgotten by mani for your past shape the path you take your past and past decis leav their mark and ha often dire consequ on your present and futur life it is a messag to be cautiou and

confus who gatsbi wa hi flaw and misplac love fore daisi wa of no consequ that wa not fitzgerald s point and mani miss it by look sole at the plot and shallow character and dialogu while fitzgerald point out mani obviou human trait snobberi excess romantic careless of other feel betray and the shallow curios of other peopl s drama as well as the social discrep between the rich and the poor scorn and with distast he wa bare skim through the true mean of hi novel it wa not a coincid that the first 3 set of the novel mirror the last 3 set of the stori in which the past meet the present and affect the futur of everi main charact the mirror imag of the begin and end of the novel close the drama that had unfold so success and so unexpectedli you have to give paus and with awe come to appreci the geniu of the writingand if that still leav you confound of what had just happen it is in the first 2 page and in the last 2 page that fitzgerald bluntli voic what he truli desir for the

positive,"A Great, Quick Read. . . .. .....and although a quick read, you will be thinking about this book for a long time.  I find myself going back to it, rereading passages and discovering something new each time.  I found the book totally relevant to our time; apparently decadence and ignorance are timeless human qualities. ; )As for the characters, they are tremendously engaging and presented in an un-heavyhanded way by Fitzgerald.  They are almost like puzzles to be solved by the reader, in our own personal way.I myself have mixed feelings for them all.  I don't trust any of them; least of all Nick, who as narrator definitely has an advantage in shaping our opinions of the other characters.  His ""are you or aren't you"" engaged status is revealed at the beginning of the book, and led me to immediately take his musings with a grain of salt.  His treatment of Jordan smacks of milque-toast-style hypocrisy as well.  Consequently, his ""you're better than all of them"" claim to Gatsby doesn't win me over; I found Gatsby to be a rather unlikable and shallow fellow.  Gatsby was clearly in over his head in courting Daisy, but continued to do it, full throttle.  Real love, or pie-in-the-sky hubris?  He admitted that the fact that Daisy was desired by so many other men made him want her even more.  This, and his inability to accept that Daisy may have loved Tom at some point hints that he is not really a man in love with a real woman, but rather a shallow twit infatuated with an ideal.  And to think, that having money is all that matters, and not how one makes it. . . again, is Gatsby a scoundrel, or just naive?I only wish the book could have been longer and more fleshed out, but its streamlined approach seems to be exactly what the author intended.",1762,"a great, quick read. . . .. .....and although a quick read, you will be thinking about this book for a long time.  i find

positive,"Read it.. The Great Gatsby is probably one of the better novels by F. Scott Fitzgerland’s is full of drama, love and a lot of excitement based in the 1920’s. I truly enjoy the descriptive ways that things were explained. It is good for anyone that doesn’t want to read a long book and it has great suspense that can keep you on the edge of your seat. Like much of Fitzgerald's prose, it is neat and well--crafted. Fitzgerald seems to have had a brilliant understanding of lives that are corrupted by greed and incredibly sad and unfulfilled. The novel is a product of its generation--with one of American literature's most powerful characters in the figure of Jay Gatsby, who is urbane and world-weary. Gatsby is really nothing more than a man desperate for love. It is a magnificent novel on every level. Fitzgerald writes about the Jazz Age in language that beautifully evokes music. He writes about a hot day in a way that almost makes you sweat. His characters are well-drawn, and the plot is engaging and fast-paced. Though this novel is possibly best appreciated by college-level readers, advanced high school students will find a lot to enjoy and discuss.",1162,"read it.. the great gatsby is probably one of the

the figure of jay gatsby, who is urbane and world-weary. gatsby is really nothing more than a man desperate for love. it is a magnificent novel on every level. fitzgerald writes about the jazz age in language that beautifully evokes music. he writes about a hot day in a way that almost makes you sweat. his characters are well-drawn, and the plot is engaging and fast-paced. though this novel is possibly best appreciated by college-level readers, advanced high school students will find a lot to enjoy and discuss.",read it the great gatsby is probably one of the better novels by f scott

positive,"Read It Again - One Of The Very Best. There are few books that I will reread, but this is definitely one of them. I know that I was supposed to read this in high school, but can't remember if I did or not. Regardless, I finally picked up another copy and read it again. There is not much else to say about this timeless American masterpiece. The writing is stunningly good, the symbolism is inspiring, and the characters are sympathetic despite their gross materialism and hollowness. This book resonates as much with our own time period as the Jazz Age that it is set in.On the surface, this is a book that tells the story of a tragic love story. Simmering just below the surface, the novel is a first-class commentary on the hollowness of the pursuit of money and things. Gatsby is at once admirable and pathetic, rich and the poorest of men. Finding purpose beyond the material world is the only thing that can differentiate us and him.If you read this in high school and remember not liking it, try it again.

positive,"Even when overused, Fitzgerald writes with simple power. It's easy to overlook The Great Gatsby. The sheer volume of partially invested high school students reading it can make the book seem trite and cliche as a point of reference for culture, allusion, or writing.

His writing is brief enough to be readable by the masses yet poignant enough to make you pause and reflect on connections to your own life, your own heart.

I had to read this book for school, and this is one of the books I actually liked. it was kinda confusing at some parts, but it was good. The ending was sad and I​ was not expecting it.

positive,"The great gatsby. The Great Gatsby book reviewOverall, i greatly enjoyed reading this book. My favorite thing about the book was how it was narrated  by Nick Caraway. One who is not considered "" one of them."" It gave the story more meaning because the events were described by  a more reliable character, rather than by one who may view the other characters as normal. The opinions were stated from a less biased opinion.  The book did also feel unique compared to the other books we read.  The overall meaning of the text was very deep. It made me really question and thing more about the American dream. I enjoy books that make me think, and I feel like it kept me curious and wondering the whole time. It incorporated big concepts such as love, social status, and satisfaction. it proves some misconceptions wrong, such as the common one of money bringing one happiness. Also, because there were multiple relationships going on between the different characters, the story line was deep. Nick and Gatsby, Gatsby and Daisy, Daisy and Tom, Tom and Myrtle, and so on. All of these intertwining connections made the story line complicated, and thus more interesting to read about.  Gatsby was also a different character. He is mysterious and unexpected, which helped to keep the readers anticipating  what happens next.  I enjoyed  how the  book contained several details that helped me to clearly visualize the scenes in my mind. I felt like I was in the 1920s. One thing i  did disliked about the book was the lack of suspense until the ending . It was interesting reading through the book, but it wasn't suspenseful enough. I felt myself losing interest at some points.

positive,"The Great Novel. After watching the visually beautiful movie The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald I felt compelled to read the novel.  Searching online for the best deal on a legitimate website I happened to come across amazon.com for the best deal.  For the incredible low price of six dollars and sixty-seven cents you can purchase a terrific story about a man doing everything he can to win back a long lost lover.  The book was hands down phenomenal keeping my attention to the very last sentence.  The novel was driven by symbolism, romanticism, and well written tragedy.  This novel has countless symbols and messages that explain relations between rich and poor.  The most famous message would have to be ""rich girls don't marry poor boys"" which is ironically found in the first movie adaption.  This movie is a perfect gift for anybody who wants to enjoy a beautifully illustrated story that shares how wealth affects the poor.  I personally think this movie has an indirect relation to the one percent and ninety percent wall street battle. The novel really focused on character development which brings you into the story. I absolutely loved reading F Scott. Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby from the first sentence to the last.  This book was so deep and emotional with I felt an unexplainable connection with the characters.  I reread the novel three times and watch the movie twice because it was just that good.  I submerged myself in tragic and romantic story about one man blinded by love willing to do anything to reconnect with a former flame.  All of my close friends and family honestly love reading this book after I recommend The Great Gatsby.  As soon as I received my online ordered novel book I couldn't put it down.  Each day my nose would be deep into the pages until I was completely finished.  Scott Fitzgerald fully grasped my attention a completely original masterpiece.  I envy F. Scott Fitzgerald for having the effort and ability to write such a perfect book that reached more than millions of people.  As you can most likely tell I very much enjoyed reading this deep and awe inspiring story and would recommend it to everyone. The Great Gatsby has received much well deserved attention in all of its movie deals, awards, and even as a reading assignment at the high school level.  This phenomenal story has received an extensive amount of attention from coast to coast.  F Scott Fitzgerald owns the title of literary genius.  Oprah Whinfrey has even read this popular book and had been chosen for her book club in the past.  This tremendous story is loved by many and enjoyed by all.  Big time actors were jumping for the chance to be a part of The Great Gatsby movie, for example the Leonardo Dicaprio.  If there are two large production movies on it you know it has to be good.  Hands down this novel is proudly recognized as one of the greatest stories ever told in American literature. The Great Gatsby is such a terrific novel for such a low price on Amazon.  This story is filled with universal messages of wealth and poverty.  This portrays how the less fortunate value and worship the rich, but the same idolization is not returned.  After tragedy strikes a two of the main characters pack their bags and leave the city without concern nor empathy.  One message conveyed that peaked my own  interest is that ""rich girls don't marry poor boys"".  This made me think about all the famous relationships and power couples in Hollywood .

relations between rich and poor the most famous message would have to be rich girls don t marry poor boys which is ironically found in the first movie adaption this movie is a perfect gift for anybody who wants to enjoy a beautifully illustrated story that shares how wealth affects the poor i personally think this movie has an indirect relation to the one percent and ninety percent wall street battle the novel really focused on character development which brings you into the story i absolutely loved reading f scott fitzgerald s the great gatsby from the first sentence to the last this book was so deep and emotional with i felt an unexplainable connection with the characters i reread the novel three times and watch the movie twice because it was just that good i submerged myself in tragic and romantic story about one man blinded by love willing to do anything to reconnect with a former flame all of my close friends and family honestly love reading this book after i recommend the great gatsby as soon as i received my online ordered novel book i couldn t put it down each day my nose would be deep into the pages until i was completely finished scott fitzgerald fully grasped my attention a completely original masterpiece i envy f scott fitzgerald for having the effort and ability to write such a perfect book that reached more than millions of people as you can most likely tell i very much enjoyed reading this deep and awe inspiring story and would recommend it to everyone the great gatsby has received much well deserved attention in all of its movie deals awards and even as a reading assignment at the high school level this phenomenal story has received an extensive amount of attention from coast to coast f scott fitzgerald owns the title of literary genius oprah whinfrey has even read this popular book and had been chosen for her book club in the past this tremendous story is loved by many and enjoyed by all big time actors were jumping for the chance to be a part of the great gatsby movie for example the leonardo dicaprio if there are two large production movies on it you know it has to be good hands down this novel is proudly recognized as one of the greatest stories ever told in american literature the great gatsby is such a terrific novel for such a low price on amazon this story is filled with universal messages of wealth and poverty this portrays how the less fortunate value and worship the rich but the same idolization is not returned after tragedy strikes a two of the main characters pack their bags and leave the city without concern nor empathy one message conveyed that peaked my own interest is that rich girls don t marry poor boys this made me think about all the famous relationships and power couples in hollywood the great gatsby is truly a unique story that encourage everyone to purchase if i had to rate this story it would get five out of five stars in my eyes,"['the', 'great', 'novel', 'after', 'watching',

positive,"illusion vs. reality; silence is not golden; a facade of gaiety comes crashing down. I first read The Great Gatsby when I was in college, for a 20th Century American Fiction class with Dr. Karen Johnson at Indiana University at Indianapolis.  I think, due to my procrastination, I had to do so just a few days before a paper on some aspect of it was due.  Can't remember what the topic was, but I know I turned it in late and Dr. Johnson was not pleased.  I got a ""C,"" I think. Now, 25 years later, I read it again at the suggestion of Robert Girardi, author of several books and a collection of short stories (""A Vaudeville of Devils,"" which I liked very much - a shameless plug).Wow.  Did I even read this book then?  I must have done so quickly and without much attention because it was a very good novel.  A bit slow at the beginning, but as I learned about the characters and their connections to one another, I had to keep reading to see how it would all end.  Tragically, by the way.  And you see it coming, though I wasn't expecting to end as tragically as it did.  Don't read further if you don't want to know what happens...So many people lying, living in a dream world: Gatsby, holding on to a past love/infatuation, believing he can re-create it years later, with a new name, a false front and all the trappings of a cultured, wealthy young man (actually gained through criminal activity);  Daisy, aware of her husband's affair with someone, yet not confronting him, and engaging in an affair of her own with Gatsby that is really doomed from the start; Myrtle, who thinks Tom loves her more than his wife, but that illusion is ""crushed"" along with her nose; the guests of Gatsby, attending his parties only to get drunk and have some fun, most not knowing their host and not caring if they don't, parties only held so Gatsby can see Daisy again.  And then there's Nick Carraway, the narrator, a self-described ""honest man"" who fails to confront these illusions with the truth.  He doesn't tell his cousin Daisy about the details of her husband Tom's affair.  Shouldn't he have, out of love for her?  And he never really confronts Gatsby about his fantasy about re-connecting with Daisy, the long-lost love of his youth.  Couldn't he have ""talked some sense into him,"" again, if he really cared about Gatsby?  And when they all have it out at the hotel in NYC, why doesn't Nick call Tom on the carpet about his second life with Myrtle, as Tom is attacking Gatsby for his affair with Daisy?  Finally, Nick could have told Wilson the truth about Myrtle and Tom after the accident, so Wilson's rage and desire for revenge would have not been misplaced.  He could also have told the police that it was Daisy, not Gatsby, who was driving the car, and that it was Tom that was having an affair with Wilson's wife.  Tom and Daisy make off like bandits, though not without scars, the illusion of their marriage apparently safe and sound; Myrtle and Wilson and Gatsby all experience the ultimate fantasy killer, death.  Even Gatsby's dad is allowed to believe that he had a good boy, a smart boy, a successful boy.  And Nick doesn't shatter his illusion.  Out of compassion?  Fear?  Indifference?  Speak up Nick; have some courage.  You're ""one of the most honest people you know.""  So tell the truth to the people around you and maybe you can help them face reality and have better, honest lives, even if the price is the death of their fantasies and pretense. Your silence helped kill these people, in a way.My two cents.  Dr. Johnson, are you out there?  I read it for real this time. What do you think?

positive,"Spoiler Alert!. This is my first time reading The Great Gatsby. This is an amazing Book. It starts off slow but as you keep reading you see a lot of character development. Fitzgerald uses this book to write a love story based in the jazz age but doesn’t make it a happily ever after novel. He pushes the harsh reality into Gatsby’s eyes and shows how shallow some rich people can be. Daisy has an undying love for Gatsby but is too afraid to make the move of leaving Tom. The story is written in the point of view of Nick Carraway, whom I believe to have the most sense out of all the Characters of the book. During the story you see his relationship with Gatsby flourish into an obsession with Gatsby. As a reader I can never expect what each character will do. When you learn about Nick and Jordan Bakers relationship you will perceive they will get together and possibly get married. As you keep reading you realize Jordan and too selfish for Nick and Nick is too consumed with Gatsby’s life to think about her. When you learn about Tom and his affair you would assume he will eventually leave Daisy to be with Myrtle Wilson.  Fitzgerald makes each character start off very simple if not predictable but as the novel continues they each become more complex and very unpredictable.

neutral,"Book Review. Melanie VelaAmerican Literature IIMs. KroneJune 2, 2005Book ReviewThe Great Gatsby is a fictional novel written by F. Scott Fitzgerald.It is a story of one man's desperate attempt at rekindling a past relationship with a beautiful woman named Daisy. She is a wealthy materialistic woman who, due to the difference of social classes, does not marry Gatsby, and while he is shipped off for war, marries a more wealthy man. The real conflict is set off when Nick Carraway, a distant cousin of Daisy comes to visit for the summer. He tries to help Gatsby win back Daisy, who has now become a very wealthy and popular man by throwing large extravagant parties.  This leads to drama and conflict This book is Fitzgerald's life in a couple hundred pages Fitzgerald is Gatsby in many ways. Gatsby moved to New York in hopes for fulfilling a dream and so too did Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald met and fell in love with a woman who would not marry him due to the fact that he had no money. He wins her over by becoming a famous author. The alcoholism that is portrayed in this play by the party guests reflects Fitzgerald who became a heavy drinker. The Great Gatsby was Fitzgerald's attempt at being remembered for a long time. It has always been his dream to be great. Gatsby was Gatz attempt at being great also. I think that is why Fitzgerald entitled his book The Great Gatsby, because Gatsby was supposed to be a great, popular guy who made something of himself. However, Gatsby wasn't great since everyone used him and his main goal to win over Daisy failed. This book was good in ways that the storyline was interesting and that the ending was very suspenseful. I also liked how Fitzgerald made the narrator a truthful and moral man as the narrator because it allowed the reader to trust that his details of the characters were right, and to trust his judgment which also allowed seeing the characteristics and personalities of each character.  Fitzgerald's in depth description of different aspects was needed but at other times it just felt like a run on words.  It at times did create the mood, but for the most part, it created a boring façade upon the reader. It was slow and the real action of the book occurred late. Overall, this book wasn't so good. I would not recommend the book to those who like action or drama in every page.

be great gatsby was gatz attempt at being great also i think that is why fitzgerald entitled his book the great gatsby because gatsby was supposed to be a great popular guy who made something of himself however gatsby wasn t great since everyone used him and his main goal to win over daisy failed this book was good in ways that the storyline was interesting and that the ending was very suspenseful i also liked how fitzgerald made the narrator a truthful and moral man as the narrator because it allowed the reader to trust that his details of the characters were right and to trust his judgment which also allowed seeing the characteristics and personalities of each character fitzgerald s in depth description of different aspects was needed but at other times it just felt like a run on words it at times did create the mood but for the most part it created a boring fa ade upon the reader it was slow and the real action of the book occurred late overall this book wasn t so good i would not recommend the book to those who like action or drama in every page the whole story was just one jumble of words that bored the reader page after page ,"['book', 'review', 'melanie',

positive,"A Classic. This brief novel about a hopeless, lovesick romantic, the Great Gatsby of the title, is full of all the longing, materialism, craziness, desperation, and need for acceptance you can find in American life and history, what Fitzgerald has narrator Nick Carraway refer to as “spectroscopic gayety”. Its characters have become classic American types: Tom Buchanan the rich Yale football player jerk; his wife Daisy the ultimate trophy wife in her white roadster with her green dock light and a voice full of money; Jordan Baker, the desiring and desirable miscreant golfer; and Nick Carraway the bitter narrator, who had so many advantages, who turned to the unending work of learning the bond trade but who got drawn into the life of Gatsby with devastating consequences for his own worldview, deeply divided though his reaction is to the unfolding tragedy he witnesses. Uniting them all at the endless parties he throws at his Long Island estate is Gatsby whose love is undying, whose idealism is perfect, whose faith in himself is limitless and whose love for Daisy means everything to him. His determination to repeat the past and win back the love of Daisy puts in motion a tragedy even his vast fortune can’t derail. The vision of this novel is deeply moral, but the novel is also poetic in its appreciation for what characterizes American life, its particular beauty and depravity. Add to that the regional theme of Middle Westerners living on the East coast, and the vivid setting of the the wild parties of New York, and what you have is a novel which expresses an attractive

positive,"The Decline of the American Dream reveals a nice life lesson in the end. This novel demonstrates the importance of creating one's own happiness and not relying on material things to generate that. Gatsby believed that by becoming rich he could solve all his problems, but that only made him more somber with his already tainted life.Gatsby had been living a tough life of rejection and decided to turn to the one thing he thought would help--money--and poured his life's ambitions into procuring that. He became so dependent on this solution that he would go to any means necessary to become rich. Gatsby would devote the next five years of his life to cheating and scheming his way to the top. He began illegal drug sales to generate more profit. His riches were gained by no honest means and represent a life of lying and shortcuts. That is no way to go about happiness. Happiness can only be achieved if one actually makes it for themselves. They cannot rely on material possessions to create that for them. Being truly happy takes effort, and that is something Gatsby does not know how to give. Taking the easy way out will never lead to any blissful ending.Gatsby has to learn that lesson the hard way as his riches begin to worsen his life, not better it, and people take advantage of him and only want him for his money. Gatsby feels lonely in this world as he begins his new life as an elite ""business man"" so he invites people over to his house to enjoy his money with him. He soon realizes that spending time and money on strangers does not make him any better off than before his riches. His money can only make others happy, not himself. Those people who he begins to believe are his friends do not care about him in the least bit; they only want him so that they can enjoy the same luxuries as he does. These people that spend all hours of the night at Gatsby's house do not appreciate him enough to come to his own funeral. No one cares about him except his father and neighbor. Having money does not make Gatsby happy and it will not make any one else happy.

positive,"Less about Wealth and Excess, More About One Man's Dream.. The Great Gatsby is less about the American Dream and more about the death of a dream; a dream one holds in one's heart, for such an inexplicably long time, that it becomes something more than a dream, something ineffable and austere. Like the previous sentence, this book is permeated with ambiguous phrasings and sentimental, other-worldly prose - that is to say, Fitzgerald has a certain writing style, and chooses to imbue his novel with a certain unabashed romanticism.Most peoples critiques of the characters are incomplete. Sure, they have money, and that might make them frivolous or careless to a certain extent, but they all have depth and breadth. The characters only seem overtly despondent because we view them through the eyes of the narrator, a person who seems somewhat detached from things, as he should be, as the novel is essentially his recollection of events. The net effect is that the novel achieves sort of a dream-like quality. The most likable of the characters is the novels name-sake, Gatsby. I read somewhere that the original editor/publisher of the book had Fitzgerald omit much of Gatsby's biography - I would have liked to know more about Gatsby. That's the great trick of the novel, the reader wants to know more about Gatsby, and when his identity and his character is revealed, it can seem anti-climatic; but when we discover why Gatsby has amassed his wealth, created his persona, and built his estate in a certain place, we realize his true intentions, and recognize them as being the best of humanity, even if they are naive and romantic notions flush with sentimentality.The plot to the novel is interesting and includes one or two twists that make it feel like an urban legend.The main sticking point of the novel (for me) is that wealth does not create happiness, nor is it a means to an end. The wealthy face all the same problems, regrets, and insecurities as everyone else, with the added burden of having money.The novel is a relatively short, enjoyable read, poetic and sublime.

negative,"The Great Gatsby is a high school level read with extravagant .... The Great Gatsby is a high school level read with extravagant words. There are a lot of strong language that makes the book hard to understand, but after a while you will start to get what the author is trying to say. Throughout the book there are many symbols that you kinda need to pay attention to or it makes the book a little hard to understand as will. I feel like there is just a lot of little details that you need to notice as well or the book can get confusing. The Great Gatsby is about love, cheating, abuse, drugs and alcohol. But I believe the book is mainly about rich stuck up people that drink too much and party too hard. The book was a slow read till you get to the last 3 chapters and let me remind you that there are only 9 chapters in the book. Many people say the book makes you think about the “American Dream” and you are supposed to think about how it evolved through the generations but that is not the vibe I got from the book. But for me reading throughout the book all it talked about was the rich people not the middle class. And if  the book were about the middle age class then maybe it would be a little more about the “American Dream” but the book has almost nothing on the middle class and how they live then  that might make the book easier to compare to the American Dream now a days which is different for every generation and or every single person. For me The Great Gatsby was not that good of a book. It’s like you might want to read it once when you are really bored kind of book. For me it’s just really slow and hard to get into.

Because he made some mistakes in figuring out how to pursue happiness, he was led only to pain, and had some trouble with trying to figure out at what point it became useless to pursue his happiness. He always longed for the early days of his youth, when he and the girl he loved--Daisy Fay--were together. Sadly they grew up, and Daisy Fay became Daisy Buchanan, and Gatsby doesn't really know how to deal with the fact that she really does love her husband. But because Daisy is connected in Gatsby's mind to everything pure and wonderful about his life, he thinks the only way he can reclaim that beauty is to win her back.Disillusionment played a large part in this book. Nick, the narrator, wanted Jay Gatsby to be happy, and did his best to help him out despite being a realist himself. The author's depressing message appeared to be that the world is going to crap and morals are degrading all over the country, and there's not much anyone can do about it. His point was well-taken even though I don't agree with it completely. It's hard not to feel hopeless sometimes when people like Gatsby are rewarded for their positive outlook by having the rug pulled from under them.",1454,"disillusionment, distilled. i read this book

positive,"A True Literary Gem. The first time I read The Great Gatsby was for school and at first I was apprehensive about it. After completing a few chapters my worries were swayed and I realized that this book would become one of my favorites. The story follows Nick Carraway around New York and his interactions with the citizens of this pretentious society mainly Tom, Daisy, and Jay Gatsby. One aspect of what makes The Great Gatsby such an excellent and timeless novel is the character development. Gatsby's character is mainly developed through interactions with Nick and Nick's descriptions and opinions of him. Also, Fitzgerald's prose and syntax come off naturally and help the flow of the novel and the accessibility of it as a whole. The tale of unrequited love and the yearning to live in the past was very identifiable to me which in return made the novel overall more appealing. Upon rereading The Great Gatsby, this time purely for pleasure, the story and the characters overall felt more real and deeper. It seems that this is one of those novels that every time you read it again it gets better and better. I have now read The Great Gatsby about four or five times and it never loses its appeal or meaning through re-readings. Isn't that what a timeless novel should do? If that's the case, then The Great Gatsby is definitely a classic novel not only because it fits the formula, but also because it's full of superb writing and characters. It's the perfect novel for someone who is unhappy with their present state or someone who loves a person but they do not feel the same way, or if you just want a well developed story that will change the way you look at things. Overall it's an excellent story that everyone should read at some point because we all of the tendency to want to relive the past and can learn the pitfall of this from none other than Jay Gatsby

positive,"Shines Brilliantly Like a Just-Discovered Piece of Cameo Jewelry from a Bygone Era. It's difficult to give any even-handed critique F. Scott Fitzgerald's standard-setting Jazz Age novel since it was required reading for most of us in high school. However, if you come back to it as a full-fledged adult, you'll find that the story still resonates but more like a just-polished cameo piece from a forgotten time. At the core of the book is the elaborate infatuation Jay Gatsby has for Daisy Fay Buchanan, a love story portrayed with both a languid pall and a fatalistic urgency. But the broader context of the setting and the irreconcilable nature of the American dream in the 1920's is what give the novel its true gravitas.Much of this is eloquently articulated by Nick Carraway, Gatsby's modest Long Island neighbor who becomes his most trusted confidante. Nick is responsible for reuniting the lovers who both have come to different points in their lives five years after their aborted romance. Now a solitary figure in his luxurious mansion, Gatsby is a newly wealthy man who accumulated his fortunes through dubious means. Daisy, on the other hand, has always led a life of privilege and could not let love stand in the way of her comfortable existence. She married Tom Buchanan for that sole purpose. With Gatsby's ambition spurred by his love for Daisy, he rekindles his romance with Daisy, as Tom carries on carelessly with an auto mechanic's grasping wife. Nick himself gets caught up in the jet set trappings and has a relationship with Jordan Baker, a young golf pro.These characters are inevitably led on a collision course that exposes the hypocrisy of the rich, the falsity of a love undeserving and the transience of individuals on this earth. The strength of Fitzgerald's treatment comes from the lyrical prose he provides to illuminate these themes. Not a word is wasted, and the author's economical handling of such a potentially complex plot is a technique I wish were more frequently replicated today. Most of all, I simply enjoy the book because it does not portend a greater significance eighty years later. It is a classic tale that provides vibrancy and texture to a bygone era.

positive,"Was Gatsby Great?. Ultimately, The Great Gatsby is about a man, Jay Gatsby, who wished to be reunited with the love of his life, who he lost 5 years ago. Daisy Buchanan is the beautiful woman in which Gatsby is seeking. Gatsby centers his entire life on this one desire, and while on his quest for Daisy, he finds himself wealthy. He originated from a poverty stricken family, and worked his way to the top. Daisy is not what she is originally portrayed as. Fitzgerald’s novel is a mediocre story, filled with a variety of figurative language, which truly enhances the story. Chapter by chapter, the reader can easily pick up on the language; imagery, metaphors, alliteration, similes, and the list goes on and on. For example, in chapter two, “This is a valley of ashes –a fantastic farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and grotesque gardens; where ashes take the form of houses and chimneys and rising smoke, and finally, with a transcendent effort, of men who move dimly through the powdery air (Fitzgerald 23). This sentence in particular, has so many wonderful examples of imagery, and metaphors that truly enhance the setting. By incorporating these, and other magnitudes of figurative language, Fitzgerald makes for a simplistic, more enjoyable read. While reading the novel, there were more times than one where I really felt like I was right in the story. Overall, I did not hate this novel, but it definitely was not my favorite. Truly, the only thing I enjoyed about Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, is the writing style. It is simplistic, with figurative language that keeps the flow of the story; other than that, it was not a great story in my opinion. The plot line is often cumbersome and confusing, with many instances of flashback. Also, the story line is lame, and if it was not an easy read, I would not have enjoyed it at all.

positive,"The Great American Novel of yesterday remains amazing today. The first time I read Gatsby was in high school, too young and coerced to come away with much but an urge to slap Daisy. The second read, in my early twenties, was magic -- I drank it in a night, awed by the grace of the language, and particularly swept up in the sad romance of it: gauche, hopeful Jay Gatsby, arms and dreams wide as he stared across the Sound at the green light at the end of Daisy's dock.This third time was the best, the purest, and if you haven't read it for a while, I urge you to pick it up again. It's truly a masterpiece, painting the whole American mess in vivid colors and flawless perspective without wasting a stroke.

positive,"Gatsby, The Great Lie. Personally this is the second time I have read The Great Gatsby, the first time in college and now 20 plus years later.  I had remembered the main storyline but had forgotten what a good read the book can be.  Fitzgerald provides a nicely written, not overly long or multifaceted story that is full of complexity and insight into America in the 1920s (and in some ways today).Everyone's life in the story seems to be based on or involves a lie (Tom and Daisy in their marriage, Daisy in her role in the death of Myrtle, Jordon's success in her profession, Myrtle and Wilson in their marriage, Meyer Wolfsheim's notoriety, and of course Gatsby in his whole being).  Even Myrtle's sister Catherine, a minor character, lies when arriving at the site of her sister's death.  All of these lies exist under the ever vigilant eyes of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg, though no one seems to have any reservation about being watched.  Nick, our narrator, claims he is one of the few honest people he has ever known.  Yet he is complacent and allows the lies to occur and, in some cases, is an actual accomplice in the carrying forth of many of the lies.  Does this make him a liar, or worse.Though ultimately a story, or statement, about 1920's America the story contains a timeless theme, true wealth can correct a lot of wrongs.  Tom and Daisy left a horrible trail behind them.  Their wealth will allow them to move forward with little to no impact.  While many of the others are not poor they lack the means, financially and mentally, to move forward the way Toms and Daisy's wealth allows them to do.Was Jay Gatsby great as supposed in the title, I don't know.  Nick seemed to have been converted to believing so at the end after despising him earlier.  Better than the whole lot he states.  But can some who is completely a fabrication be great?  The obvious answer is yes as we have seen it through the ages but I don't know about Gatsby.Enjoy the book.  It's a great read that has multiple layers.",2007,"gatsby, the great lie. personally this is the second time i have read the great gatsby, the first time in college and now 20 plus years later.  i had

jordon's success in her profession, myrtle and wilson in their marriage, meyer wolfsheim's notoriety, and of course gatsby in his whole being).  even myrtle's sister catherine, a minor character, lies when arriving at the site of her sister's death.  all of these lies exist under the ever vigilant eyes of dr. t. j. eckleburg, though no one seems to have any reservation about being watched.  nick, our narrator, claims he is one of the few honest people he has ever known.  yet he is complacent and allows the lies to occur and, in some cases, is an actual accomplice in the carrying forth of many of the lies.  does this make him a liar, or worse.though ultimately a story, or statement, about 1920's america the story contains a timeless theme, true wealth can correct a lot of wrongs.  tom and daisy left a horrible trail behind them.  their wealth will allow them to move forward with little to no impact.  while many of the others are not poor they lack the means, financially and mentally, to move forward the way toms and daisy's wealth allows them to do.was jay gatsby great as supposed in the title, i don't know.  nick seemed to have been converted to believing so at the end after despising him earlier.  better than the whole lot he states.  but can some who is completely a fabrication be great?  the obvious answer is yes as we have seen it through the ages but i don't know about gatsby.enjoy the book.  it's a great read that has multiple layers.",gatsby the great lie personally this is the second time i have read the great gatsby the first time in college and now 20

positive,"Fantastic. Most classics fall into one of two traps. The first: thick, tedious prose, tiny font, 800 pages of 18th, 19th century drama. The second: a theme so blatant it sits beating the reader on the head, neglecting the fact that stories still have things called a story. Most fall into one of those two situations--thick or preachy.Not Gatsby. Oh no. Gatsby falls into neither classic trap. You can read it in a day and enjoy yourself doing it. Actually, you can read it in a few hours and enjoy yourself just as much as if you were rereading The Hobbit or Harry Potter. Then, once you've finished, you look back and see, to your wonderment, how powerful and deep The Great Gatsby really is.And that is only part of Fitzgerald's success.The entire work is highly precise. Every word has its reason for being there. None are wasted. The themes are embedded in precise locations so as not to jump out at the reader and consequently distract them from the story.Speaking of the story, Fitzgerald does what many classical novelists fail to do--tell one. Fitzgerald told a story about this man, Gatsby, who invented himself. As a result, he told a story about following dreams, and ambition, and living life, and viewing life, and carelessness. But he told the story about Gatsby, and the people around him, first.In that way, he avoided theme device, and plot devices, and made for an impeccable, enjoyable, thought-provoking read.

the great gatsby.",fantastic most classics fall into one of two traps the first thick tedious prose tiny font 800 pages of 18th 19th century drama the second a theme so blatant it sits beating the reader on the head neglecting the fact that stories still have things called a story most fall into one of those two situations thick or preachy not gatsby oh no gatsby falls into neither classic trap you can read it in a day and enjoy yourself doing it actually you can read it in a few hours and enjoy yourself just as much as if you were rereading the hobbit or harry potter then once you ve finished you look back and see to your wonderment how powerful and deep the great gatsby really is and that is only part of fitzgerald s success the entire work is highly precise every word has its reason for being there none are wasted the themes are embedded in precise locations so as not to jump out at the reader and consequently distract them from the story speaking of the story fitzgerald does what many classical novelists fail to do tell one fitzgerald told a story about this man gatsby who invented himself as a result he told a story about following dreams and ambition and living life and viewing life and carelessness but he told the story about gatsby and the people around him first in that way he avoided theme device and plot devices and made for an impeccable enjoyable

negative,"The Great Gatsby. The Great Gatsby is a book about the upper class in New York. It shows you how luxurious life can be but also how money doesn't bring total happiness. In this book the main character Nick Carraway is trying to break away from his country background and finds himself living in New York. What this book shows  and what Nick finds out and doesn't like are the selfishness of the rich community, the backstabbing, and the shallowness in everybody. These are the reasons that Nick movies back to the country and marries his hometown sweetheart. In my opinion I didn't like this book for the same reason that Nick left to go back to the country. I thought it was a very difficult book to read because there was never any positive happening to these people and it moved at a slow pace. All the ladies in this book were selfish, shallow sluts who didn't care about  anyone but themselves. This is shown when Daisy Buchanan has an affair with Gatsby. At the end of the book, when it comes down to choosing who she wanted to be with, she pick her husband just because Tom could offer her security and the life style she is accustomed to, not for true love. The men are not any better. They are also shallow, careless, and like to take risks. For example, Tom Buchanan is having an affair with Myrtle Wilson. Myrtle is the wife of George Wilson who owns a garage in the Valley of Ashes. Tom keeps an apartment for her in the city during this book which is the scene of a rather wild party. Even though I didn't like this book there were still a few parts that I liked. I thought it was sort of sweet how Gatsby had a never-ending love for Daisy. Even though she didn't deserve the kind of love Gatsby gave her, the relationship was kind of a fairytale without a happy ending. I also thought the way Gatsby died was interesting. It was perfect timing for a death  because he never had to go through life suffering, knowing that Daisy his obsession, would never be with him. It was ironic that George Wilson was the one who shot Gatsby because Wilson thought Gatsby was the one who had an affair with and murdered his wife. In fact Gatsby did neither and the only one who came on top was Tom Buchanan, who was responsible for causing pain in both of the men's lives. All in all I didn't like this book. It was slow moving, boring, and depressing. If I had to recommend this book to a group of people, it would be to adults/teenagers with a lot of time on there hands or if you just like gossip.",2500,"the great gatsby. the great gatsby is a book

doesn t bring total happi in thi book the main charact nick carraway is tri to break away from hi countri background and find himself live in new york what thi book show and what nick find out and doesn t like are the selfish of the rich commun the backstab and the shallow in everybodi these are the reason that nick movi back to the countri and marri hi hometown sweetheart in my opinion i didn t like thi book for the same reason that nick left to go back to the countri i thought it wa a veri difficult book to read becaus there wa never ani posit happen to these peopl and it move at a slow pace all the ladi in thi book were selfish shallow slut who didn t care about anyon but themselv thi is shown when daisi buchanan ha an affair with gatsbi at the end of the book when it come down to choos who she want to be with she pick her husband just becaus tom could offer her secur and the life style she is accustom to not for true love the men are not ani better they are also shallow careless and like to take risk for exampl tom buchanan is have an affair with myrtl wilson myrtl is the wife of georg wilson who own a garag in the valley of ash tom keep an apart for her in the citi dure thi book which is the scene of a rather wild parti even though i didn t like thi book there were still a few part that i like i thought it wa sort of sweet how gatsbi had a never end love for daisi even though she didn t deserv the kind of love gatsbi gave her the relationship wa kind of a fairytal without a happi end i also thought the way gatsbi die wa interest it wa perfect time for a death becaus he never had to go through life suffer know that daisi hi obsess would never be with him it wa iron that georg wilson wa the one who shot gatsbi becaus wilson thought gatsbi wa the one

thi book it wa slow move bore and depress if i had to recommend thi book to a group of peopl it would be to adult teenag with a lot of time on there hand or if you just like gossip

positive,"What it means to be an American. After living abroad in the Middle East for a year and traveling through more than twenty-five countries, I recently re-read The Great Gatsby, seeking the familiarity of America.  The Great Gatsby captures what is different about Americans and the American experience.  At its most basic, America represents endless striving for greatness.  Whether in business, science, athletics or world affairs, Americans imagine and seek the best.  Though we often stumble and fall short; though we often cut corners to achieve our dreams - striving for greatness is the essence of America.  In Gatsby, we feel what it is like to want something so badly, to succeed in reaching it and to ultimately fail.  How many of us have not shared these experiences in some way or another?  American writings today, such as David Ebershoff's Pasadena (2002) and Scott Gaille's The Law Review (2002), continue to explore Gatsby's central theme of obsession with greatness.  In this time of global uncertainty, we can get back in touch with what it means to be an American by reading such books.",1102,"what it means to be an american. after living abroad in the middle east

neutral,"A Classic. The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Where do I begin with this one? Gatsby is a classic and was on my optional reading list for school. I had chosen another novel to read but decided to read this one too because there was a movie coming to theaters that I had a major interest in seeing. I heard from many people that this was “the best book they have ever read” and that it “kept them entertained for hours”. However, when I read it, I did not experience the same thing.Even though it was very well written, I found this novel uninteresting and hard to get into. Maybe it was because this novel is almost a century old and the diction of writers has changed since then. Maybe it was because I read it at a time that I didn’t have a lot going on and was using this novel to keep me entertained. Or maybe it was because I had such high expectations for it.Overall, The Great Gatsby tells a great story of a man and his parties. It is a deep novel that will invoke some deep thinking. I personally think the movie was more enjoyable than the novel, quite possibly because there was less description of what was going on and more dialogue. I have found that I enjoy novels with some description but with an equal amount of dialogue just to keep things interesting. I believe that if this novel were to have more conversational portions, I would have enjoyed it a lot more.

positive,"appreciate the language. This is not a perfect novel.  The characters are underdeveloped.  It is difficult to care about some of them either way.  The story line is melodramatic, and it does not break any new ground.However, the real joy of the book it the language it is written in.  Try reading it aloud.

positive,"The Great Gastsby: A Classic. The Great Gatsby, a fictional novel written by Scott Fitzgerald in 1925, is perhaps one of the greatest classics of twentieth-century literature as well as the greatest achievement of Fitzgerald's career. It is a brilliant mix of romance and tragedy interwoven with an intricately crafted tale of the American society in the 1920s. Its engaging story, complex social themes, and memorable character portrayals have mesmerized the readers for almost a century.Many fiction books are merely for entertainment, but The Great Gatsby simultaneously entertains and informs its audience. It is a novel that combines the pleasures of the literary fiction with the American history. The Great Gatsby follows the  story of Daisy, her rustic husband Tom, and her wealthy former lover, Gatsby, whose mysterious personality and extravagant parties are a source of gossip. The entire story is narrated by Nick Carraway, a World War veteran who spends a summer in a rental house surrounded by the lavish mansions of his cousin Daisy. Over the course of the novel, Nick becomes caught up in the mechanism of many romantic triangles and acquires mature understanding of the life on the prosperous East Coast. The novel is set in the prosperous Long Island in 1920s, and it accurately depicts the social history of America in the roaring 20s. The era, particularly known for prosperity, jazz music, flapper culture and illegal activities is criticized by Fitzgerald in this novel.The engaging plot and fast paced writing excites the reader and makes it a thrilling adventure. Fitzgerald's description of rekindling of love between Daisy and Gatsby is fabulous--“His heart beat faster and faster as Daisy’s white face came up to his own. He knew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable visions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like the mind of God... Then he kissed her"". It was also exciting to read about the extravagant parties ""where the lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun"" and the tension between Tom and Daisy. You can almost feel the exuberance of the parties as well as long lasting sadness due to the conflicts between the characters. The true essence of the novel comes not only from its plot, but also from its dynamic characters who handle themselves into complex situations.Fitzgerald uses characters as symbolic representations of the social trends in the 1920s. There are many characters, but one of the most dynamic is the title character himself-Jay Gatsby, who is the epitome of the Great American Dream. He is a self-made men who achieved the American dream of rising from the lower to upper class of the society, though by illegal means. The Great Gatsby introduces several themes that truly characterizes the American society in the 1920s. Fitzgerald portrays the roaring 20s as a decade of unprecedented prosperity, but he also describes it as a decade of decadence. The theme of social class is depicted throughout the novel which shows the development of class rivalry between “old” and “new” money due to minute differences.The language of the novel is accessible to both high school and college students. But, Fitzgerald's use of rhetorical devices such as symbolism could only be understood if one analyzes and reads critically. Since so many social issues are addresses in the novel, I believe this book appeals to a wide audience as many can make some personal connections with the characters and their struggles. I highly recommend this book to everyone before watching the movie.",3594,"the great gastsby: a classic. the great gatsby, a fictional novel written by scott fitzgerald in 1925, is perhaps one of the

positive,"The Great Gatsby – Can you repeat the past?. Jay Gatsby builds a fortune, buys a mansion in fictional West Egg, NY, across the bay from Tom and Daisy Buchanan’s old-money mansion in East Egg.  In an effort to win back the girl he loves, Gatsby throws lavish parties, hoping Daisy will show, or at the least, that he will meet someone who knows her.  What follows is a story of wealth, marriage, excess and the romantic notion that you can repeat the past.Set in 1922, these characters live during the wild party atmosphere of the Roaring Twenties.  The Great Gatsby is about a time when new money moves into the old money world and about the contrasting lives of all classes, including the very poor who live in “the valley of ashes,” a desolate area between Long Island and the city.If you’ve never read The Great Gatsby, that’s enough to get you started.  Besides money, it’s a great story about love, romance, marriage and betrayal, with well-placed foreshadowing and a tragic plot-twist at the end.I hadn’t read The Great Gatsby since college and it was fun to go back and pick up on things I’m sure I missed way back then!  I think this is a great book to re-read because of the dialogue – Fitzgerald’s characters say a lot of things that mean a great deal more when you read the book a second or third time.Here are some of the things I liked this time:I like how Fitzgerald includes Jordan Baker’s character and how he suggests that Jordan has been dishonest in the past.  She seems smooth and professional and successful, but her small lies, at least regarding her golf game, still trail her, if you look closely.  Gatsby, also of questionable background, tells Nick that Jordan has a good reputation.  “Miss Baker’s a great sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all right,” he says.I like all the foreshadowing with the cars and about driving and about accidents.  I like the discussions about being bad drivers and how the best way to avoid another bad driver is to pair up with a good driver.  I like the literal and symbolic parallels.I love how, when Nick asks Gatsby what part of the Mid-West he’s from, he answers, “San Francisco.”  It’s a great example of showing how Gatsby is lying, rather than just saying so.The whole theme of past versus present and recreating the past is always a very interesting subject, because it’s emotional and romantic.  Gatsby is sure he can recreate the past, Nick isn’t so sure and Daisy, in the ultimate confrontation at The Plaza, says, “I can’t help what’s past,” crushing Gatsby’s dream.Nick Calloway’s strong desire to believe Gatsby, despite everything that suggests a dubious past.  When Gatsby finally explains his Oxford connection, Nick says, “I wanted to get up and slap him on the back.  I had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that I’d experienced before.”I also like how Fitzgerald includes Meyer Wolfsheim’s character, who is based on the very real Arnold Rothstein.  (You can get an idea of what Rothstein was like by watching “Boardwalk Empire” – one of my favorite shows!)  Wolfsheim only appears a couple times, but his name comes up a lot and as the story goes on, he’s the key to knowing about Gatsby and how he’s made his money.The Great Gatsby is a classic.  It wasn’t a success while Fitzgerald was alive. Some people love it, some don’t, and lots of high-schoolers read it in their English classes.  I enjoyed it very much and particularly liked comparing it to the movies made in 1974 and 2013.  Those movies are shockingly different, but similar in many ways.  But that’s tomorrow’s blog!Here are a couple links that I found interesting:PBS website called The History Kitchen – an overview of Prohibition during the Roaring Twenties, The Great Gatsby, and a recipe for “The Bees Knees” cocktai[...]Here’s something interesting about the original cover of The Great Gatsby:[...]The cover of the first printing of The Great Gatsby is among the most celebrated pieces of art in American literature. It depicts disembodied eyes and a mouth over a blue skyline, with images of naked women reflected in the irises. A little-known artist named Francis Cugat was commissioned to illustrate the book while Fitzgerald was in the midst of writing it. The cover was completed before the novel; Fitzgerald was so enamored with it that he told his publisher he had ""written it into"" the novel.  Fitzgerald's remarks about incorporating the painting into the novel led to the interpretation that the eyes are reminiscent of those of fictional optometrist Dr. T. J. Eckleburg (depicted on a faded commercial billboard near George Wilson's auto repair shop) which Fitzgerald described as ""blue and gigantic – their retinas are one yard high. They look out of no face, but instead, from a pair of enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a non-existent nose."" Although this passage has some resemblance to the painting, a closer explanation can be found in the description of Daisy Buchanan as the ""girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs."" Ernest Hemingway wrote in A Moveable Feast that when Fitzgerald lent him a copy of The Great Gatsby to read, he immediately disliked the cover, but ""Scott told me not to be put off by it, that it had to do with a billboard along a highway in Long Island that was important in the story. He said he had liked the jacket and now he didn't like it.""",5424,"the great gatsby – can you repeat the past?. jay gatsby builds a fortune, buys a mansion in fictional west egg, ny, across the bay from tom and daisy buchanan’s old-money mansion in east egg.  in an effort to win back the girl he loves, gatsby throws lavish parties, hoping daisy will show, or at the least, that he will meet someone who knows her.  what follows is a story of wealth, marriage, excess and the romantic notion that you can repeat the past.set in 1922, these characters live during the wild party atmosphere of the roaring twenties.  the great gatsby is about a time when new money moves into the old money world and about the contrasting lives of all classes, including the very poor who live in “the valley of ashes,” a desolate area between long island and the city.if you’ve never read the great gatsby, that’s enough to get you started.  besides money, it’s a great story about love, romance, marriage and betrayal, with well-placed foreshadowing and a tragic plot-twist at the end.i hadn’t read the great gatsby since college and it was fun to go back and pick up on things i’m sure i missed way back then!  i think this is a great book to re-read because of the dialogue – fitzgerald’s characters say a lot of things that mean a great deal more when you read the book a second or third time.here are some of the things i liked this time:i like how fitzgerald includes jordan baker’s character and how he suggests that jordan has been dishonest in the past.  she seems smooth and professional and successful, but her small lies, at least regarding her golf game, still trail her, if you look closely.  gatsby, also of questionable background, tells nick that jordan has a good reputation.  “miss baker’s a great sportswoman, you know, and she’d never do anything that wasn’t all right,” he says.i like all the foreshadowing with the cars and about driving and about accidents.  i like the discussions about being bad drivers and how the best way to avoid another bad driver is to pair up with a good driver.  i like the literal and symbolic parallels.i love how, when nick asks gatsby what part of the mid-west he’s from, he answers, “san francisco.”  it’s a great example of showing how gatsby is lying, rather than just saying so.the whole theme of past versus present and recreating the past is always a very interesting subject, because it’s emotional and romantic.  gatsby is sure he can recreate the past, nick isn’t so sure and daisy, in the ultimate confrontation at the plaza, says, “i can’t help what’s past,” crushing gatsby’s dream.nick calloway’s strong desire to believe gatsby, despite everything that suggests a dubious past.  when gatsby finally explains his oxford connection, nick says, “i wanted to get up and slap him on the back.  i had one of those renewals of complete faith in him that i’d experienced before.”i also like how fitzgerald includes meyer wolfsheim’s character, who is based on the very real arnold rothstein.  (you can get an idea of what rothstein was like by watching “boardwalk empire” – one of my favorite shows!)  wolfsheim only appears a couple times, but his name comes up a lot and as the story goes on, he’s the key to knowing about gatsby and how he’s made his money.the great gatsby is a classic.  it wasn’t a success while fitzgerald was alive. some people love it, some don’t, and lots of

class includ the veri poor who live in the valley of ash a desol area between long island and the citi if you ve never read the great gatsbi that s enough to get you start besid money it s a great stori about love romanc marriag and betray with well place foreshadow and a tragic plot twist at the end i hadn t read the great gatsbi sinc colleg and it wa fun to go back and pick up on thing i m sure i miss way back then i think thi is a great book to re read becaus of the dialogu fitzgerald s charact say a lot of thing that mean a great deal more when you read the book a second or third time here are some of the thing i like thi time i like how fitzgerald includ jordan baker s charact and how he suggest that jordan ha been dishonest in the past she seem smooth and profession and success but her small lie at least regard her golf game still trail her if you look close gatsbi also of question background tell nick that jordan ha a good reput miss baker s a great sportswoman you know and she d never do anyth that wasn t all right he say i like all the foreshadow with the car and about drive and about accid i like the discuss about be bad driver and how the best way to avoid anoth bad driver is to pair up with a good driver i like the liter and symbol parallel i love how when nick ask gatsbi what part of the mid west he s from he answer san francisco it s a great exampl of show how gatsbi is lie rather than just say so the whole theme of past versu present and recreat the past is alway a veri interest subject becaus it s emot and romant gatsbi is sure he can recreat the past nick isn t so sure and daisi in the ultim confront at the plaza say i can t help what s past crush gatsbi s dream nick calloway s strong desir to believ gatsbi despit everyth that suggest a dubiou past when gatsbi final explain hi oxford connect nick say i want to get up and slap him on the back i had one of those renew of complet faith in him that i d experienc befor i also like how fitzgerald includ meyer wolfsheim s charact who is base on the veri real arnold rothstein you can get an idea of what rothstein wa like by watch boardwalk empir one of my favorit show wolfsheim onli appear a coupl time but hi name come up a lot and as the stori goe on he s the key to know about gatsbi and how he s made hi money the great gatsbi is a classic it wasn t a success while fitzgerald wa aliv some peopl love it some don t and lot of high schooler read it in their english class i enjoy it veri much and particularli like compar it to the movi made in 1974 and 2013 those movi are shockingli differ but similar in mani way but that s tomorrow s blog here are a coupl link that i found interest pb websit call the histori kitchen an overview of prohibit dure the roar twenti the great gatsbi and a recip for the bee knee cocktai here s someth interest about the origin cover of the great gatsbi the cover of the first print of the great gatsbi is among the most celebr piec of art in american literatur it depict disembodi eye and a mouth over a blue skylin with imag of nake women reflect in the iris a littl known artist name franci cugat wa commiss to illustr the book while fitzgerald wa in the midst of write it the cover wa complet befor the novel fitzgerald wa so enamor with it that he told hi publish he had written it into the novel fitzgerald s remark about incorpor the paint into the novel led to the interpret that the eye are reminisc of those of fiction optometrist dr t j eckleburg depict on a fade commerci billboard near georg wilson s auto repair shop which fitzgerald describ as blue and gigant their retina are one yard high they look out of no face but instead from a pair of enorm yellow spectacl which pass over a non exist nose although thi passag ha some resembl to the paint a closer explan can be found in the descript of daisi buchanan as the girl whose disembodi face float along the dark cornic and blind sign ernest hemingway wrote in a moveabl feast that when fitzgerald lent him a copi of the great gatsbi to read he immedi dislik the cover but scott told me not to be put off by it that it had to do with a billboard along a highway in long island that wa import in the stori he said he had like the jacket and now he didn t like it

positive,"A Great American Novel. When I was seventeen and believed I knew things about literature, I wrote a review that both dismissed this book, and talked childishly of how a teacher reading too much into it, and demanding explanations from everything about the book, had made the text boring, and poor.  I deleted that review, and now, six years later, returning to the book, and reading it in one sitting, I have come to an entirely new conclusion.  After literally hundreds of books, from Hemingway to Faulkner, to Joyce and Woolf, to Kerouac and Heller, the poetics of this book, of Fitzgerald's writing, is to be marvelled and enjoyed.The story of Jay Gatsby, told through the eyes of Nick Carraway is a wonderful experience that every American, nay I say, every human being should experience.  This is a text of utter beauty, filled with the poetry of life in it's lines.  It moves us forward into the realization of the failure of the American Dream.  It is a tragedy, it is a romance, it is a story of class, it is the story of an American soul seeking both victory and redemption.  The writing erupts from the page like sparks from sparklers, each page burning with radiant descriptions, powerful imagery, and insight that you wish was constant in the literature of today.The Great Gatsby is a timeless novel, capable of being enjoyed by anyone, black or white, rich or poor, American or European or Asian.  It is a novel that goes beyond that of a moment in history, and becomes a part of the soul.  It captures more than the heart of man, but the heart of life itself.  To recommend this book would be to say that this book needs a recommendation, but, if time and history are not clear indicators of its greatness, than it's opening pages should be.",1755,"a great

negative,"Unpleasant and nihilistic -- why is this a classic again?. I leave this review fully aware that I'm going to catch flak for it.  How dare I belittle a classic novel, after all, one beloved by generations of readers.  Well, simply because a book is a ""classic"" doesn't mean that it's necessarily going to appeal to all tastes, nor that it's a masterfully written novel.  It simply means that it was popular or meaningful enough to endure, or that it's worked its way into school curriculum.  And while I never had to read ""The Great Gatsby"" for school, I did watch the film version and found it lacking.  But I was still willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and give it a shot -- the movie was obviously trying to ape ""Moulin Rouge,"" and perhaps the book would provide a better experience.I don't understand why this book is a classic.  It is unpleasant, full of unsympathetic characters, and all-around overrated.""The Great Gatsby"" is narrated by Nick, a young man from the Midwest who moves to New York City during the Roaring Twenties and finds himself drawn to his mysterious, charismatic neighbor, Jay Gatsby.  Gatsby is fabulously wealthy, and constantly throws wild, lavish parties at his home.  Nick becomes obsessed with Gatsby, trying to unravel his past (and finding countless contradictory stories about said past from various acquaintances), and soon becomes swept up in Gatsby's mad quest to achieve his ultimate goal... to win the heart of the woman he fell in love with as a young soldier so many years ago.  But in trying to capture his elusive prize, Gatsby will set off a chain of events that will destroy lives... the only question is whose, and who will escape in the aftermath.I know, the above description makes the book sound intriguing.  But in all actuality, the book is incredibly dull.  Nothing of import happens until a third of the way through, and the book is larded with pointless conversations that ultimately go nowhere.  I ended up skimming large parts simply because they consisted of nothing but characters aimlessly gasbagging about things that ended up having no influence on the plot.  This book could easily be condensed into a novella or even a short story without losing anything plotworthy.I can better tolerate pointless content in a book if said content is written well.  But Gatsby's prose is bland at best, awkward at worst, and never truly captured me.  It's not terrible writing -- I've certainly read worse, especially in modern novels -- but neither is it very good, let alone great.  (I'm told there's some controversy over whether F. Scott Fitzgerald really wrote this book, and some attribute it to his wife Zelda, but regardless of who wrote it, the writing is nothing to write home about.)The characters are unlikable as well.  Gatsby is a sad excuse of a human being, not caring who he hurts in his quest to win his true love, even descending to drug-dealing and homewrecking.  The girl of his dreams isn't much better, and comes across as painfully shallow.  Her husband, and the closest thing this book has to an antagonist, isn't much better than Gatsby himself -- he's also racist, but then, this book was written in the '20s, and some uncomfortable elements of older novels are simply products of their time.  The narrator, Nick, is the closest thing to a decent human being the book has, and even then he comes across as a wet blanket, letting himself be walked on and not bothering to get involved when events take a turn for the worse.  Some might argue that the unlikable characters are the point of this book, that it was meant to show the shallowness and corruption of the day, but a cast of unlikable characters will make your book VERY unpleasant.Finally, without spoiling too much... the ending of the book renders the entire rest of the story pointless.  The characters have gained nothing, learned nothing, and in the end the moral of the story seems to be ""isn't this world a terrible place?""  I don't demand a happy ending from everything I read, but this book isn't so much a sad ending as it is a nihilistic one.

(i'm told there's some controversy over whether f. scott fitzgerald really wrote this book, and some attribute it to his wife zelda, but regardless of who wrote it, the writing is nothing to write home about.)the characters are unlikable as well.  gatsby is a sad excuse of a human being, not caring who he hurts in his quest to win his true love, even descending to drug-dealing and homewrecking.  the girl of his dreams isn't much better, and comes across as painfully shallow.  her husband, and the closest thing this book has to an antagonist, isn't much better than gatsby himself -- he's also racist, but then, this book was written in the '20s, and some uncomfortable elements of older novels are simply products of their time.  the narrator, nick, is the closest thing to a decent human being the book has, and even then he comes across as a wet blanket, letting himself be walked on and not bothering to get involved when events take a turn for the worse.  some might argue that the unlikable characters are the point of this book, that it was meant to show the shallowness and corruption of the day, but a cast of unlikable characters will make your book very unpleasant.finally, without spoiling too much... the ending of the book renders the entire rest of the story pointless.  the characters have gained nothing, learned nothing, and in the end the moral of the story seems to be ""isn't this world a terrible place?""  i don't demand a happy ending from everything i read, but this book isn't so much a sad ending as it is a nihilistic one.  it's as if the author set out to

review fulli awar that i m go to catch flak for it how dare i belittl a classic novel after all one belov by gener of reader well simpli becaus a book is a classic doesn t mean that it s necessarili go to appeal to all tast nor that it s a master written novel it simpli mean that it wa popular or meaning enough to endur or that it s work it way into school curriculum and while i never had to read the great gatsbi for school i did watch the film version and found it lack but i wa still will to give it the benefit of the doubt and give it a shot the movi wa obvious tri to ape moulin roug and perhap the book would provid a better experi i don t understand whi thi book is a classic it is unpleas full of unsympathet charact and all around overr the great gatsbi is narrat by nick a young man from the midwest who move to new york citi dure the roar twenti and find himself drawn to hi mysteri charismat neighbor jay gatsbi gatsbi is fabul wealthi and constantli throw wild lavish parti at hi home nick becom obsess with gatsbi tri to unravel hi past and find countless contradictori stori about said past from variou acquaint and soon becom swept up in gatsbi s mad quest to achiev hi ultim goal to win the heart of the woman he fell in love with as a young soldier so mani year ago but in tri to captur hi elus prize gatsbi will set off a chain of event that will destroy live the onli question is whose and who will escap in the aftermath i know the abov descript make the book sound intrigu but in all actual the book is incred dull noth of import happen until a third of the way through and the book is lard with pointless convers that ultim go nowher i end up skim larg part simpli becaus they consist of noth but charact aimlessli gasbag about thing that end up have no influenc on the plot thi book could easili be condens into a novella or even a short stori without lose anyth plotworthi i can better toler pointless content in a book if said content is written well but gatsbi s prose is bland at best awkward at worst and never truli captur me it s not terribl write i ve certainli read wors especi in modern novel but neither is it veri good let alon great i m told there s some controversi over whether f scott fitzgerald realli wrote thi book and some attribut it to hi wife zelda but regardless of who wrote it the write is noth to write home about the charact are unlik as well gatsbi is a sad excus of a human be not care who he hurt in hi quest to win hi true love even descend to drug deal and homewreck the girl of hi dream isn t much better and come across as pain shallow her husband and the closest thing thi book ha to an antagonist isn t much better than gatsbi himself he s also racist but then thi book wa written in the 20 and some uncomfort element of older novel are simpli product of their time the narrat nick is the closest thing to a decent human be the book ha and even then he come across as a wet blanket let himself be walk on and not bother to get involv when event take a turn for the wors some might argu that the unlik charact are the point of thi book that it wa meant to show the shallow and corrupt of the day but a cast of unlik charact will make your book veri unpleas final without spoil too much the end of the book render the entir rest of the stori pointless the charact have gain noth learn noth and in the end the moral of the stori seem to be isn t thi world a terribl place i don t demand a happi end from everyth i read but thi book isn t so much a sad end as it is a nihilist one it s as if the author set out to write an unpleas and cynic book simpli to make hi stori meaning or deep i don t understand whi the great gatsbi is consid such a classic it s unpleas and miser to read without a singl sympathet charact in the cast and without ani sort of meaning resolut all i can say is that i m glad i wa never forc to read thi in school

positive,"Tragedy of a forlorn lover. Written for a generation that was brought up on Haratio Alger's formulaic juvenile novels, F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""Great Gatsby"" dispels the myth of the American Dream.  If you want to read a rags-to-riches story with a happy ending, you had better read something by Jackie Collins. Jay Gatsby is a tragic antihero who rises from humble beginnings to flamboyant riches while chasing a single dream. Nick, the narrator, describes Gatsby as having an ""extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness such as I have never found in another person and which it is not likely I shall ever find again."" If money cold by everything, then Gatsby would have been the most fortunate of men. Unfortunately, his dream became an illusion. On Gatsby's deathbed, Nick ponders that Gatsby ""paid a high price for living too long with a single dream."" The reality of the situation is that Gatsby is a man in love. His life was a concerted effort focused solely on winning Daisy back: acquiring wealth, buying the house across the bay, throwing his lavish parties, and befriending Nick.Gatsby is tragic because he, like everyone else, suffered from loneliness and wanted to experience authentic caring. He thought he found that in Daisy. He spent his life building wealth, mostly illicitly, in a misguided scheme to bring Daisy to him. Money was not his end but the means to his end. The people with money, represented by Tom and Daisy, do not care about authenticity or love: ""They were careless people, Tom and Daisy - they smash up things and creatures and then retreat back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up their mess for them.""  In a classically tragic ending, death is abundant. Not just people, but dreams. Gatsby's image of Daisy that Gatsby built up is now completely dead. The reality fails to live up to his expectations.  The reality of the situation is that Gatsby was a man in love with an image.  While Gatsby concentrated all of his life on winning Daisy back, the nouveau riche could not see  beyond their own enjoyment. Told with an eye for cynicism, The Great Gatsby is an American classic and beautifully written; any group of lines can be extracted and appreciated on their own merits. The message of the Great Gatsby is just as poignant today as it was in the Jazz age.",2386,"tragedy of a forlorn lover. written for a generation that was brought up on haratio alger's formulaic

positive,"Beautiful, Romantic, Tragic. I don't know how I made it through high school without reading this classic, but I'm so glad I get to come back to books like this and read them as an adult.  I'm sure I would have learned stuff in high school, but I feel like I'm getting more appreciation out of books like this as I get older.The only thing I knew about this book before I started reading was that it was a shallow love story that ends with the girl dumping the poor, innocent guy....or something.  And yes that is the plot, but I think the story can also be about the American dream and who it's really available to.  What is the American dream? Is it just getting money and it doesn't matter how? Did we really get away from social inequality?  I hadn't really thought about any of that before reading this book.  It made me wonder what my American dream is.  Do I just want to get lots of money, a big house, and tons of stuff? Or is there more to it than that?  Without spoiling the end, I feel like Mr. Fitzgerald's opinion on the matter is that some people are born to live the American dream and some aren't - and there isn't much you can do to change it.  The fate of Daisy and Gatsby really brings that tragic idea home.The parties were unreal. I was drooling over the mention of all the food.  I couldn't help but imagine the Dowager Countess from Downton Abbey coming to Gatsby's house and being appalled at what Americans called ""a dinner party.""  My mind was buzzing with all the practical details and sheer amount of money that it would take to feed two dinners and tons of alcohol to that many people... But the parties and glamour are just covering up the fact that most of these people are shady, immoral, hypocritical and just plain unhappy.  Especially Tom and his wife Daisy.I loved the writing.  It was simple, charming, and witty - an interesting contrast to the much deeper story going on.  The last line about how we can't escape from the past points out that even though as Americans we say that anyone can achieve wealth, happiness and equality, the truth is we keep getting sucked into the rules of the past.The only thing I thought was overdone was the symbolic Eye Doctor bilboard in the ash valley. Don't let the symbolic Eye Doctor Ad/God's Judgement fall on you on the way out.Overall, a novel that got me really thinking about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the context of a beautiful, tragic, and romantic story.",2459,"beautiful, romantic, tragic. i don't know how i made it through high school without reading this classic, but i'm so glad i get to come back to books like

to change it.  the fate of daisy and gatsby really brings that tragic idea home.the parties were unreal. i was drooling over the mention of all the food.  i couldn't help but imagine the dowager countess from downton abbey coming to gatsby's house and being appalled at what americans called ""a dinner party.""  my mind was buzzing with all the practical details and sheer amount of money that it would take to feed two dinners and tons of alcohol to that many people... but the parties and glamour are just covering up the fact that most of these people are shady, immoral, hypocritical and just plain unhappy.  especially tom and his wife daisy.i loved the writing.  it was simple, charming, and witty - an interesting contrast to the much deeper story going on.  the last line about how we can't escape from the past points out that even though as americans we say that anyone can achieve wealth, happiness and equality, the truth is we keep getting sucked into the rules of the past.the only thing i thought was overdone was the symbolic eye doctor bilboard in the ash valley. don't let the symbolic eye doctor ad/god's judgement fall on you on the way out.overall, a novel that got me really thinking about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness in the context of a beautiful, tragic, and romantic story.",beautiful romantic tragic i don t know how i made it through high school without reading this classic but i m so glad i get to come back to books like this and read them as an adult i m sure i would have learned stuff in high school but i feel like i m getting more appreciation out of books like this as i get older the only thing i knew about this book before i started reading was that it was a shallow love story that ends with the girl dumping the poor innocent guy or something and yes that is the plot but i think the story can also be about the american dream and who it s really available to what is the american dream is it just getting money and it doesn t matter how did we really get away from social inequality i hadn t really thought about any of that before reading this book it made me wonder what my american dream is do i just want to get lots of money a big house and tons of stuff or is there more to it than that without spoiling the end i feel like mr fitzgerald s opinion on the matter is that some people are born to live the american dream

positive,"Gatsby refreshed. Since any attempt to offer fresh insights into this classic novel of the Jazz Age would be futile, I can only propose another way to appreciate the reading experience. That's by viewing the most recent Gatsby movie first. After seeing it and marveling at the way the excesses of the 20's were portrayed, I decided to reread the book. The combination of the two experiences were mutually reinforcing. It turns out that the movie follows the plot of the book quite accurately. In fact, many of the famous lines from the book are included in the movie. Because of that precise tracking, it was possible to focus on and appreciate more the amazing writing. No need to strain to follow the plot.  Conversely, scenes in the book are made more vivid by visualizing scenes from  the movie. For example, the movie does a fabulous job of depicting a wild party at Gatsby's mansion. Also, the casting of the actors is consistent with their role in the book.So, see the movie and then read or reread the book.

The Great Gatsby
.]My comments below for anyone considering a second reading of this most durable of American novels.When I opened up The Great Gatsby once again, this time in middle age, I was impressed by how triumphantly the novel belongs to the wide, ongoing current of American literature. The well-read Fitzgerald took seriously literature's calling and his own role within its tradition. And since its publication in 1925, Gatsby has exerted a gravitational pull on American literature.Readers returning to this book after an absence of decades are apt to notice how much it has served as a source of ideas and inspiration to subsequent American writers. The book is amazing on its own merits, of course, but there's additional pleasure in store for the seasoned reader as you spot affinities and influences based on your own reading history. Among the authors I believe The Great Gatsby influenced are Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, J.D. Salinger, and John Updike. This aspect of Fitzgerald's achievement was totally lost on me back in high school.When Daisy castigates Tom as ""a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen,"" chances are good you'll be reminded of the tension between Blanche DuBois and Stanley Kowalski. When Nick, organizing the funeral, utters two devastating words -- ""Nobody came"" -- you may think of Willy Loman's widow, Linda, at the end of ""Death of a Salesman,"" expressing her pained confusion: ""Why didn't anybody come? Where are all the people he knew? Maybe they blame him."" Then there's the bit of magic when Fitzgerald, in the opening chapter, transforms a ringing telephone into a living character capable of disordering a marriage -- an audacity I'm guessing John Updike was aware of and decided to pay homage to in his short story on the subject of adultery, ""Your Lover Just Called,"" found in the 1972 collection, ""Museums & Women and Other Stories"" (out of print; the story is now available in The Maples Stories (Everyman's Library Pocket Classics)).I was surprised to discover how strong Gatsby's imprint was on ""The Catcher in the Rye"" (1952). There's a kinship, I think, between Holden and Nick Carraway, who, while older (29 going on 30), is in many ways just as unanchored as Holden, or Huck Finn for that matter. Each is a person whose moral education is not yet complete, each is a persona still in formation.Both ""Catcher"" and ""Gatsby"" use the framing device of a narrator who has escaped the scene of an intensely personal experience -- one that has run them down physically and emotionally. What Nick describes as his summer of ""riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the human heart"" could, with some tailoring, fit the days Holden describes to us as ""this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas"". Both characters, now in recovery, convey their tales from a safe distance: Nick is ""back home"" in the middle west; Holden is in a California sanitarium, about to go back home. At the end of their stories Holden and Nick engage in virtually identical, small, symbolic acts in an attempt to rid their world of indecency: Holden erases an obscene graffiti in the stairwell of his sister Phoebe's school; Nick scrapes away an obscene word that a truant scrawled on the steps of his friend Gatsby's mansion.Fitzgerald himself was a self-described ""enthusiastic worshipper"" of T.S. Eliot, and if Eliot's poetry pleases you, there is pleasure to be had in discovering the impact of his verse throughout The Great Gatsby. Nick Carraway's character and behavior fits the mold of the narrator of ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock."" Nick is glad to be of use to Daisy and Gatsby, and his attachment to Gatsby may well be described as that of an attendant Lord, one whose actions are deferential, politic, cautious, a bit obtuse. In the end Nick recognizes himself as, maybe, the Fool. I believe some details and incidents in the novel are loosely borrowed from ""Prufrock."" For example, its easy to view Nick's perambulation of Manhattan in Chapter 3 (""At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting loneliness sometimes, and felt it in others--poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows"") to be a variation on Prufrock's habit of wandering at dusk through narrow streets to watch lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows. Prufrock's seaside romantic fantasy becomes Nick's street-side daydream; in both cases their yearnings are unrequited, since Prufrock's imagined mermaids will not sing to him, and Nick's elusive girls ""fade through a door into warm darkness.""Yet the essential lessons of The Great Gatsby are of a different category, beyond the driving theme of nostalgia, and so much more than the colossal vitality of Gatsby's illusion. Otherwise, why would its final sentence -- ""So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past"" -- have become inseparably bound to our vision of America? One of the rewards of re-reading the novel is to discover how carefully, how relentlessly, the author prepares us for this final revelation.",5277,"""the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men"".

describes to us as this madman stuff that happened to me around last christmas both characters now in recovery convey their tales from a safe distance nick is back home in the middle west holden is in a california sanitarium about to go back home at the end of their stories holden and nick engage in virtually identical small symbolic acts in an attempt to rid their world of indecency holden erases an obscene graffiti in the stairwell of his sister phoebe s school nick scrapes away an obscene word that a truant scrawled on the steps of his friend gatsby s mansion fitzgerald himself was a self described enthusiastic worshipper of t s eliot and if eliot s poetry pleases you there is pleasure to be had in discovering the impact of his verse throughout the great gatsby nick carraway s character and behavior fits the mold of the narrator of the love song of j alfred prufrock nick is glad to be of use to daisy and gatsby and his attachment to gatsby may well be described as that of an attendant lord one whose actions are deferential politic cautious a bit obtuse in the end nick recognizes himself as maybe the fool i believe some details and incidents in the novel are loosely borrowed from prufrock for example its easy to view nick s perambulation of manhattan in chapter 3 at the enchanted metropolitan twilight i felt a haunting loneliness sometimes and felt it in others poor young clerks who loitered in front of windows to be a variation on prufrock s habit of wandering at dusk through narrow streets to watch lonely men in shirt sleeves leaning out of windows prufrock s seaside romantic fantasy becomes nick s street side daydream in both cases their yearnings are unrequited since prufrock s imagined mermaids will not sing to him and nick s elusive girls fade through a door into warm darkness yet the essential lessons of the great gatsby are of a different category beyond the driving theme of nostalgia and so much more than the colossal vitality of gatsby s illusion otherwise why would its final sentence so we beat on boats against the current borne back ceaselessly into the past have become inseparably bound to our vision of america one of the rewards of re reading the novel is to discover how carefully how relentlessly the author prepares us for this final revelation ,"['the', 'abortive', 'sorrows', 'and', 'short', 'winded', 'elations',

positive,"Great book. I think The Great Gatsby is a really good book. It's one of those that you will remember for a long time. Some of the themes are a little bit depressing, but they potray human nature pretty well. It has a perfect ending, with a resolution, that many other books lack. At the beginning it might seem a little bit boring, but once it picks up the action, it's hard to stop reading.

positive,"Must Read thriller (This review contains some spoilers of the book). Having a degree in writing from the University of Princeton, F. Scott Fitzgerald is in the perfect position to write his best selling novel The Great Gatsby. This story is seen through the eyes of Character Nick Carraway,who has just moved to New York as he tells the story of how his relationship came to be with Jay Gatsby, Nicks mysterious, rich neighbor, The three central issues that this book focuses on have to be, The relationship between Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan, the relationship between Tom Buchanan and Myrtle Wilson and the relationship between George Wilson and Jay Gatsby. All of those three relationships/ issues relate to the central theme of ¨What is the good life?¨. Fitzgerald's novel does an excellent job of constructing this theme, having it be represented by three different ongoing issues throughout the novel.As stated previously the story is narrated by Nick Carraway, who just moved to New york, starting a job as a bond salesman. He rents a house in Long Island in a fictional village called West Egg, next door to the mansion of the mysterious Millionaire Jay Gatsby who throws major parties all the time. Soon after, Nick establishes a friendly relationship with him, after running into him at one of his parties. Nick plays the role of what one could say ¨messenger boy¨ or ¨bystander¨ as this exciting story takes place, meaning he sees pretty much everything that is going on.Throughout the novel it becomes very clear that the theme of the story is Wealth will never satisfy your desires, it just gives you a craving to always want more. Jay Gatsby has a huge mansion, expensive clothes with tons of money, yet still he is unsatisfied with what he has and wants more as he uses Nick to get to win over his former lover Daisy from her husband Tom unfortunately for him he fails as Thomas tells Daisy that Jay is a criminal and that is the only reason why he has money. Ironically Tom falls into the same boat Jay is in, Tom has a beautiful wife, a large house, he was a football star at yale and also has a ton of money. However, this is not enough for Tom as Nick finds out through Jordan that Tom has a mistress who lives between West Egg and New York City. Throughout the novel, readers can clearly see that pretty much none of the characters from the story are happy at all. They are unsatisfied with love, marriage, and most importantly they are unsatisfied with themselves. According to The Great Gatsby, wealth will never satisfy your desires, it just gives you a craving to always want more.Thomas Buchanan develops from overall just a great successful guy to someone who isn't satisfied with all the the nice things he has and starts an affair. Tom had such a successful uprising. He was the star of the football team at yale, getting into college for free because of it. He was born into a wealthy family, has a beautiful wife and daughter, has good looks and as his wife says, he is¨ a brute of a man, a great, big, hulking physical specimen.¨ (Fitzgerald 12). He also has what one would call a ¨cocky¨ attitude as he states that ¨… i'm stronger and more of a man than you are¨(Fitzgerald 7) while talking to Nick. unfortunately this still wasn't enough for Thomas as he still craved more,  having multiple affairs with woman while being a married man and a father. Thomas Buchanan is living proof that being wealthy doesn't mean being happy and satisfied with what you have.F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel The Great Gatsby is a novel that truly is a must read. Through plot twists and turns, the reader is truly mesmerised by this book trying to interpret what happens next. Overall, Fitzgerald's thriller of a novel is truly a must read and deserves a score of 9.0/10.0",3786,"must read thriller (this review contains some spoilers of the book). having a degree in writing

positive,"It Still Holds. Rereading F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby after something like half a century, I was swept up and overwhelmed by it all over again.  From the first sentence until the last, you know you’re in the hands of a writer both gifted and accomplished.  He didn’t need hundreds and hundreds of pages in order to leave us one of the greatest American literary works of the 20th Century.  (The Scribner paperback is just 180 pages.)The time may be the 1920s, but that turns out not to be the distant past.  Early on, at a perfectly rendered effete Long Island dinner, the host, talking about a book he’s been reading, may sound like someone you remember from your college class or even your current neighbor:  “This fellow has worked out the whole thing.  It’s up to us, who are the dominant class, to watch out or those other races will have control of things.”The social satire of the book is more pertinent than ever.  Here’s a passage that comes when the narrator steps out of his house while Gatsby and Daisy are getting reacquainted:“There was nothing to look at from under the tree except Gatsby’s enormous house, so I  stared at it, like Kant at his church steeple, for half an hour.  A brewer had built it early in the ‘period’ craze a decade before, and there was a story that he’d agreed to pay five years’ taxes on all the neighboring cottages if the owners would have their roofs thatched with straw.  Perhaps their refusal took the heart out of his plan to Found a Family — he went into an immediate decline.  His children sold his house with the black wreath still on the door.  Americans, while occasionally willing to be serfs, have always been obstinate about being peasantry.”Almost 100 years after the book was first published, particularly in the light of more recent events, a reader has to be stopped when Gatsby characterizes someone as “the man who fixed the World Series back in 1919”  and the narrator then muses:“The idea staggered me.  I remembered, of course, that the World Series had been fixed in 1919, but if I had thought of it at all, I would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of some inevitable chain.  It never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people — with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.“ ‘How did he happen to do that?’ I asked after a minute.“ ‘He just saw the opportunity.’“ ‘Why isn’t he in jail?’“ ‘They can’t get him, old sport.  He’s a smart man.’”If you’ve experienced The Great Gatsby only in an adaptation, you owe it to yourself to encounter the book itself.You can turn it into a movie or an opera and there may be things that you gain (cinematography, music), but what you lose is Fitzgerald’s immortal writing.  That’s a terrible loss.",2793,"it still holds. rereading f. scott fitzgerald’s the great gatsby after something like half a century, i was swept up and overwhelmed by it all over again.  from the first sentence until the last, you know you’re in the hands of a writer both gifted and accomplished.  he didn’t need hundreds and hundreds of pages in order to leave us one of the greatest american literary works of the 20th century.

positive,"love the book, love the movie even more. The Great Gatsby, written by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a timeless classic that explores the wonders of the 1920’s and the selfish, intriguing people living in that era. Taking place in New York City and the suburbs that surround it, Fitzgerald tells a tale involving love triangles, scandals, new friends and raging parties. With a set of characters that are always entangled in a mess along with the lively nights of a New York 1920’s summer, The Great Gatsby is sure to keep you interested and appreciative of the era.  Bond salesman Nick Caraway brings us along on his experiences with the mysterious Gatsby in his new town. He has just moved to New York and currently resides in West Egg, living next to a giant mansion that houses massive parties on the weekends. Nick soon finds himself in the interest of the man who owns this mansion, and quickly becomes caught up in a new mess involving family and friends. One of my favorite quotes lies within the first paragraph of the novel. Nick says “In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.’Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,’ he told me, ‘just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.’ ” This quote captures his morals and his outlook on life, which is important to know as you follow him through the story.  I highly recommend reading The Great Gatsby, whether it’s during free time or for a book club. Fitzgerald keeps you interested, while not providing an overwhelming amount of events that you cannot keep up with. However, this may be a downfall if you’re the type of person who needs constant action to keep interested in a book. Still, it is not a long book at 180 pages, and with a surprising series of events at the end of the novel it is well worth the time spent reading. In addition, the movie created in 2013 of The Great Gatsby is a refreshingly accurate motion picture of Fitzgerald’s book which I would also recommend watching after reading the book.",2091,"love the

first paragraph of the novel. nick says “in my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that i've been turning over in my mind ever since.’whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,’ he told me, ‘just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.’ ” this quote captures his morals and his outlook on life, which is important to know as you follow him through the story.  i highly recommend reading the great gatsby, whether it’s during free time or for a book club. fitzgerald keeps you interested, while not providing an overwhelming amount of events that you cannot keep up with. however, this may be a downfall if you’re the type of person who needs constant action to keep interested in a book. still, it is not a long book at 180 pages, and with a surprising series of events at the end of the novel it is well worth the time spent reading. in addition, the movie created in 2013 of the great gatsby is a refreshingly accurate motion picture of fitzgerald’s book which i would also recommend watching after reading the book.",love the book love the movie even more the great gatsby written by f scott fitzgerald is a

The Great Gatsby also raises many big question that carry through to today: does money truly bring happiness, is true love worth the risk, and what extent should you go to to get it? This story is narrated by Mr. Nick Carraway, a Minnesota man in the search of the wealth and status available in Manhattan. He moves to a small house on the island of East Egg and lives next door to the mysterious Jay Gatsby. Across the water of the island lives Mr. Carraway’s cousin Daisy and her husband Tom Buchanan (who Nick attended Yale with and is very openly cheating on his wife).

But it is more than that; it cuts deep into the pitfalls of the Jazz Age: that easily gotten money is easily parted with, that money can buy everything.

positive,"Great Gatsby. This is a great novel.  I really liked reading this.  The narration by Nick Carroway gives the story some distance from Gatsby and the other characters.  His pursuit of Daisy Buchanan ends tragically, with the husband of the accident victim blaming Gatsby for her death.  He then shots Gatsby in his swimming pool.  The writing by Fitzgerald is of a very high quality, and standard.  The character of Gatsby is a bit of an enigma.  He gains wealth in order to try and rekindle his relationship to Daisy, who is married to a thug.  Although the parties at Gatsby's house are glamorous and decadent, the novel is really a warning about the consequences of the love of wealth and status on society.  Daisy will not leave her husband because she does not want to sacrifice her status and access to wealth.  I particularly liked the last 50 pages or so of the novel.  There is a number of passages that contain great writing.  The ending was very sad, but it was in keeping with the story.  I will always remember reading this book for another reason.  Just before I read about Gatsby's death, I heard about someone close to a member of my family, who had been unjustly murdered.  We had seen him only months before.  It obviously made reading about Gatsby's death more painful.  I suppose it is just one of life's coincidences.",1337,"great gatsby. this is a great novel.  i really liked reading this.  the narration by nick carroway gives the story some distance from gatsby and

to wealth i particularly liked the last 50 pages or so of the novel there is a number of passages that contain great writing the ending was very sad but it was in keeping with the story i will always remember reading this book for another reason just before i read about gatsby s death i heard about someone close to a member of my family who had been unjustly murdered we had seen him only months before it obviously made reading about gatsby s death more painful i suppose it is just one of life s coincidences ,"['great', 'gatsby', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'great', 'novel', 'i', 'really', 'liked',

positive,"Definitely a great American novel!. Prior to starting this novel, I was convinced I had read it some time in school while I was growing up.  Throughout my public school education, we had read a variety of classics from Steinbeck, Dickens, Hemingway, Miller, etc.  So I really thought I had read this one along the way.  After a couple of paragraphs, I realized that I hadn't, because I think I would have remembered the different feel this one seems to have from most classic American literature.The length of the novel alone is enough to show you that it's not quite the same as some of those other novels.  Fitzgerald seemed to have more of a sense of what to cut out and what to include than some of his contemporaries, because at no point during this reading did I sit and think ""Will you just get ON with it?!?""  I'm sad to say that I have done that with plenty of other authors, so I was a bit worried I'd have that reaction when going through The Great Gatsby.  I very happily enjoyed this novel and hope to read more of Fitzgerald's work in the future.The book itself is the tragic tale of our title character, Jay Gatsby.  Having never been satisfied with the life he came from, Gatsby invents a new self and goes about trying to find the person he wants to be.  Along the way, he meets Daisy, who becomes the big driving force in his life.  I think in today's day and age, we might call Gatsby a stalker - he's obsessive and goes so far as to buy his house in Long Island because of his ability to see Daisy's across the way.  While this would seem creepy if we were telling it from a modern perspective, it strikes me as being rather sad.  Gatsby goes from only knowing he wants to make money, to knowing he wants to make money for Daisy.  At one point during the story, he even says that he decided doing things was less important than telling Daisy about all the things he wanted to do.  It's really a sad case of lost boy syndrome, in my book.Something that really stuck out to me throughout the book was that people seemed to want to be around Gatsby, but no one necessarily seems to like him, going so far as to spread random rumors about how he acquired his fortune and what his past was like.  This theme carries through to the end when we learn that our narrator, Nick Carraway, is the only one who is truly there for Gatsby in his time of need.  While Gatsby isn't a model citizen, he doesn't seem all that scandalous to me, and certainly doesn't deserve the rumor mongering that follows him throughout the course of the novel.  Maybe it's just the fact that I'm looking at it from a modern perspective, so his actions don't seem any worse than things we see on TV on a daily basis.I picked this book up for Banned Books Week, and found it rather amusing when I was investigating the reasoning behind the banning of this book.  It was basically for language and some mild sexual content, which is just ridiculous.  I certainly didn't see any bad language when reading it, and the only references to sex were along the lines of ""so and so left the room for awhile"".  Again, maybe it's a more modern perspective, but those things are just silly.  I'm totally against the banning of books anyway, so I guess I've got a skewed perspective twice over.The only questionable thing for me is really the behavior of Daisy's husband, Tom Buchanan.  I found Tom to be annoying, as arrogant as he is described, and a bigot to top it off.  It's made worse by the knowledge that men like Tom did exist, and to an extent they still do.  Still, that's no reason to ban a book, it's just a reason to dislike Tom and root for Gatsby.I really would be curious to see what kind of things Fitzgerald would have come up with if he lived in our time.  It's a shame we lost him all too soon, because I think he has a unique voice and I would have liked to see more from him.",3870,"definitely a great american novel!. prior to starting this novel, i was

school educ we had read a varieti of classic from steinbeck dicken hemingway miller etc so i realli thought i had read thi one along the way after a coupl of paragraph i realiz that i hadn t becaus i think i would have rememb the differ feel thi one seem to have from most classic american literatur the length of the novel alon is enough to show you that it s not quit the same as some of those other novel fitzgerald seem to have more of a sens of what to cut out and what to includ than some of hi contemporari becaus at no point dure thi read did i sit and think will you just get on with it i m sad to say that i have done that with plenti of other author so i wa a bit worri i d have that reaction when go through the great gatsbi i veri happili enjoy thi novel and hope to read more of fitzgerald s work in the futur the book itself is the tragic tale of our titl charact jay gatsbi have never been satisfi with the life he came from gatsbi invent a new self and goe about tri to find the person he want to be along the way he meet daisi who becom the big drive forc in hi life i think in today s day and age we might call gatsbi a stalker he s obsess and goe so far as to buy hi hous in long island becaus of hi abil to see daisi s across the way while thi would seem creepi if we were tell it from a modern perspect it strike me as be rather sad gatsbi goe from onli know he want to make money to know he want to make money for daisi at one point dure the stori he even say that he decid do thing wa less import than tell daisi about all the thing he want to do it s realli a sad case of lost boy syndrom in my book someth that realli stuck out to me throughout the book wa that peopl seem to want to be around gatsbi but no one necessarili seem to like him go so far as to spread random rumor about how he acquir hi fortun and what hi past wa like thi theme carri through to the end when we learn that our narrat nick carraway is the onli one who is truli there for gatsbi in hi time of need while gatsbi isn t a model citizen he doesn t seem all that scandal to me and certainli doesn t deserv the rumor monger that follow him throughout the cours of the novel mayb it s just the fact that i m look at it from a modern perspect so hi action don t seem ani wors than thing we see on tv on a daili basi i pick thi book up for ban book week and found it rather amus when i wa investig the reason behind the ban of thi book it wa basic for languag and some mild sexual content which is just ridicul i certainli didn t see ani bad languag when read it and the onli refer to sex were along the line of so and so left the room for awhil again mayb it s a more modern perspect but those thing are just silli i m total against the ban of book anyway so i guess i ve got a skew perspect twice over the onli question thing for me is realli the behavior of daisi s husband tom buchanan i found tom to be annoy as arrog as he is describ and a bigot to top it off it s made wors by the knowledg that men like tom did exist and to an extent they still do still that s no reason to ban a book it s just a reason to dislik tom and root for gatsbi i realli would be curiou to see what kind of thing fitzgerald would have come up with if he live in our time it s a shame we lost him all too soon becaus i think he ha a uniqu voic and i would have like to see more from him
positive,"The Great American Book : The Great Gatsby :). The Great Gatsby by F. Scotts Fitzgerald, takes place in the nineteen-twenty’s. The Great Gatsby is narrated by one of the main characters Nick Carraway. Nick tells his perception of the people around him.  This story follows the truth, the riches, the love life and the death of a man named James Gatz. (Later turned Jay Gatsby) During this time women were not thought to be equal to a man. During this time women were finding themselves getting more risqué. The Great Gatsby has a lot of examples of this. Fitzgerald has a vivid understanding of lives that are besmirched by self-indulgence are exceptionally miserable and unsatisfied. This book boils down to the most prevailing character Jay Gatsby, who is polished and world-discontented is nothing more, then a man apprehensive for love. When reading this book take in all the beautiful language. With this language you will be able to paint a depiction of what’s going one in the novel. Mature readers best cherish the language and symbolism in this novel. Readers interested in this book should be able to evaluate situations in the novel and analytically think. When you read this book be sure to keep a dictionary close by. Even though the language is beautiful it is also very challenging.

positive,"""I like big parties"". Read Gatsby again after many years to enable discussion with granddaughter.  It was great all over again.  A compelling story of wealthy, vapid society of the time.

positive,"Gatsby? What Gatsby?. Page Terror Reviews: pageterror.wordpress.comI have read F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby on the fourth of July every year since I was twelve years old. I am very much aware that I have promised the reader a review on Henry James’s The Bostonians. However, I feel that tradition in this instance takes precedence and that James can always wait another week.Gatsby holds not only a unique place in the black pit that is my heart, but also in the world of the twentieth century novel. A social history of America during the 1920′s, Fitzgerald critically assesses the growing developments and the coinciding flux of values that percolated throughout the age, exploding with the inevitable defeat of man’s spiritual being by the impounding dominance of materialism. The narrative is a beautiful balance of simplicity and bounding poetics, wrapped up in the dark mysticism of possibility and the timeless allure of slow and unavoidable ruin.The characters are products of their context. It is through his portrayal of types and the boundaries that they may cross that Fitzgerald is able to bring to life the reality of his period. His elegant and yet brutally honest fixtures are not at the mercy of a universe that he has plucked out of the ether. Instead, they are the world and what we see exudes from their speech, actions, and the nature of their internal dichotomies. Each possesses an inner battle that reflects the age that they were created to mirror. Even Nick, who as the narrator only exists in relation to the people and story he is depicting, fights for understanding, causing him to hover in a multi-dimensional construction.There is the misconception that Gatsby is about the Roaring Twenties, the decade of sin and continuous partying that people partook in to overcome the catastrophic effects of the First World War. The glittery and undeniably sad actuality of this piece and time cannot be denied. However, what The Great Gatsby is truly about, where the irrevocable magic of the story extends from, is not the party scenes. It is not the mob allusions, the mansions, or the fancy cars. At its core, The Great Gatsby is about the transcendence of the human spirit, the innate connection of the individual with the universe, and its promised destruction. We witness this in Jay the moment before he kisses Daisy and then we watch as it is resigned and burned and Jay becomes in essence mortal, a demi-god who has relinquished his immortality for the physical.I will end this little ditty by informing my reader that Daisy is my favorite character and that she always has been. The reader can easily write her off as irritating and weak and she can be both of those things. However, that is not all of Daisy and to do so does not only comment on your own lack of empathy, but it is also an insult to Fitzgerald. Daisy is the great tragedy of the novel. To characterize her with her worst attributes is to reduce her to the mere shadow of a person, not acknowledging her as a full-bodied individual with potential. We as the reader have the privilege to see that potential rise once more from the ashes before collapsing in final defeat, submitting to the destiny that was created for her at birth by those who sought to dim the light that would continue to flicker, green across the bay, before disappearing forever into the fog.pageterror.wordpress.com",3395,"gatsby? what gatsby?. page terror reviews:

positive,"Still relevant. Somehow, I missed this novel in high school, and am glad that it was not crammed down my throat as mandatory reading. The story is narrated by a young man named Nick Carraway, who moves to the fictional Long Island town of West Egg, right next door to the lavish mansion of Jay Gatsby. Through the parties he throws, Gatsby proves to be a man who relishes extravagance, although no one is quite certain where he came from or how he made his fortune. As the narrator is slowly sucked into Gatsby's world of turbulent lavishness, Gatsby tries to show that he is motivated by something much deeper than trinkets, bobbles and shiny things. Fitzgerald's style is fresh even almost a century after it was written, and the themes and relationships he creates are as relevant today as they had been in the roaring twenties. Fitzgerald's dry wit permeates throughout as he uses the novel to criticize certain excesses of a prosperous era. Thorough elements both blunt and subtle, Fitzgerald first paints a glimmering picture that is slowly peeled away to reveal levels of dirty grime underneath. As the story comes together and careens towards its haunting conclusion, the reader begins to question even the appropriateness of the novel's title itself.",1259,"still relevant. somehow, i missed

positive,"Jordan's ball. Two or three remarkable things about this famous novel:a)The main place of action brings in mind the archetypical scenery of a greek tragedy or a Shakespearian play: two magnificent houses (Gatsby's and Buchanan's), imitating the palaces of two antagonistic kings in a drama, the theater being as well represented by a limited part of earth, a certain i s l a n d. The site encloses the power of a separate, mythic world while it helps Gatsby to shine as a king in every metaphorical meaning of the word. Additionally, it is surrounded by and expanded to the city life (traffic, middle class apartments and dull office blocks) as if this life were originated from and depending on that core, that splendid island kingdom (And not vice versa, which of course is the reality).b) The form described above is given neither to crystallized human pictures from the past nor to some idealized future visions, but to contemporary characters and elements. An author who infuses the air of classic into his own time is really great.c) The book is a masterpiece of the ""show, don't tell"" principle. Almost every single paragraph would support it, yet the most remarkable trick is the author's indirect commenting the basic story (the Gatsby-Daisy affair) by introducing seemingly unrelated episodes with minor characters whose quality, revealed by plain acting, can be used as a comment to the main heroes' attitude. The most admirable of those `secondary"" and seemingly ""unnecessary"" little stories is Jordan's golf- ball old scandal: why is the author bothered to so explicitly inform us of Jordan's having been dishonest at a golf tournament? Why is the narrator, Nick, referring to women's dishonesty in general? And what would be the novel itself without this certain detail, Jordan's golf ball by which she once cheated a game? Probably it would be the same. Except, D a i s y's (and not Jordan's of course) cowardice and dishonesty, which is not at all commented after Gatsby's sacrifice, is the key not only to the plot finale but to almost everything one would discuss about the book. (Notable also that immediately after Nick's reflecting on that rumor about Jordan's cheating,the conversation between the two goes on about her way of d r I v I n g! It seems the author gives us reading directions!).

Gatsby always throws parties for the rich and famous. Gatsby loves throwing parties, saying “And I like large parties. They’re so intimate. At small parties there isn’t any privacy.”  Gatsby invites Nick to one of his parties and becomes friends with this man. He meets Jordan, a professional golfer and becomes close friends with her. Over the next few weeks, however, Gatsby falls in love with Nick’s cousin, Daisy, who has a husband named Tom and a mistress named Myrtle. Things go sour when Daisy and Myrtle both shy away from Tom for other men, Gatsby and a man named Wilson. The the first death happens when Gatsby and Daisy accidentally hit and kill Myrtle. From this point on it’s nearly impossible to put the book down! The Great Gatsby is a classic that represents the American dream of being rich and famous.

More than once my heart ached for him and I was curious and not very optimistic about how this story was going to end. But it was written so beautifully and harmonically that I just could not find myself leaving this story alone.

positive,"Liked it, but didn't love it. I don't know how I got through high school without having to read The Great Gatsby, but the truth is that I have only recently read it for the first time.  Whenever I mentioned I was reading it to friends, they all said something along the lines of ""That is one of my favorites.  You are going to love it.""  Sadly, I did not.Sure, the writing style was truly impressive.  Fitzgerald really has a way with words.And, admittedly, the storyline is interesting.  When Nick Carraway rents a small house on Long Island in 1922, he quickly gets drawn into the shady lives of his wealthy neighbors, including the mysterious Jay Gatsby who lives in the lavish mansion right next door.  In my humble opinion, the plot read like a juicy tabloid magazine about affluent socialites.While I enjoyed the book, I think the reason I didn't love it is that I didn't really care for any of the characters.  Deceit, arrogance, entitlement, infidelity . . . none of them really conducted themselves in a respectable manner.  The narrator, Nick, was benign enough, but he struck me as relatively colorless.  He merely served as the observer of the scrupleless folks around him.Despite these shortcomings, I can still genuinely recommend that you read the book.  It's a notable American classic, a quick and easy read, and you really should read it before you go see the new movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio this month.  So read it and enjoy it.

positive,Nick Carraway. I've read Gatsby a few times now. It goes without saying that it is one of the greatest American novels of all time. The point of view of Nick Carraway is what makes Gatsby so unique. He leads us into a world of complicated characters whose motivations are clear to everyone but themselves. The story reads as a bit of a mystery and a tragedy. The reader can't help but ask: who is Gatsby? A question that is only answered with his downfall.,456,nick carraway. i've read gatsby a few times now. it goes without saying that it is one of the greatest american novels of all time. the point of view of nick carraway is what makes gatsby so unique. he leads us into a world of complicated characters whose motivations are clear to everyone but themselves. the story reads as a bit of a mystery and a tragedy. the reader can't help but ask: who is gatsby? a question that is only answered with his downfall.,nick carraway i ve read gatsby a few times now it goes without saying that it is one of the greatest american novels of all time the point of view of nick carraway is what makes gatsby so unique he leads us into a world of complicated characters whose motivations are clear to everyone but themselves the story reads as a bit of a mystery and a tragedy the reader can t help but ask who is gatsby a question that is only answered with his downfall ,"['nick', 'carraway', 'i', 've', 'read', 'gatsby', 'a', 'few', 'times', 'now', 'it', 'goes', 'without', 'saying', 'that', 'it', 'is', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'greatest', 'american', 'novels', 'of', 'all', 'time', 'the', 'point', 'of', 'view', 'of', 'nick', 'carraway', 'is', 'what', 'makes', 'gatsby', 'so', 'unique', 'he', 'leads', 'us', 'into', 'a', 'world', 'of', 'complicated', 'characters', 'whose', 'motivations', 'are', 'clear', 'to', 'everyone', 'but', 'themselves', 'the', 'story', 'reads', 'as', 'a', 'bit', 'of', 'a', 'mystery', 'and', 'a', 'tragedy', 'the', 'reader', 'can', 't', 'help', 'but', 'ask', 'who', 'is', 'gatsby', 'a', 'question', 'that', 'is', 'only', 'answered', 'with', 'his', 'downfall']","['nick', 'carraway', 'read', 'gatsby', 'times', 'goes', 'without', 'saying', 'one', 'greatest', 'american', 'novels', 'time', 'point', 'view', 'nick', 'carraway', 'makes', 'gatsby', 'unique', 'leads', 'us', 'world', 'complicated', 'characters', 'whose', 'motivations', 'clear', 'everyone', 'story', 'reads', 'bit', 'mystery', 'tragedy', 'reader', 'help', 'ask', 'gatsby', 'question', 'answered', 'downfall']","['nick', 'carraway', 'i', 've', 'read', 'gatsbi', 'a', 'few', 'time', 'now', 'it', 'goe', 'without', 'say', 'that', 'it', 'is', 'one', 'of', 'the', 'greatest', 'american', 'novel', 'of', 'all', 'time', 'the', 'point', 'of', 'view', 'of', 'nick', 'carraway', 'is', 'what', 'make', 'gatsbi', 'so', 'uniqu', 'he', 'lead', 'us', 'into', 'a', 'world', 'of', 'complic', 'charact', 'whose', 'motiv', 'are', 'clear', 'to', 'everyon', 'but', 'themselv', 'the', 'stori', 'read', 'as', 'a', 'bit', 'of', 'a', 'mysteri', 'and', 'a', 'tragedi', 'the', 'reader', 'can', 't', 'help', 'but', 'ask', 'who', 'is', 'gatsbi', 'a', 'question', 'that', 'is', 'onli', 'answer', 'with', 'hi', 'downfal']", nick carraway i ve read gatsbi a few time now it goe without say that it is one of the greatest american novel of all time the point of view of nick carraway is what make gatsbi so uniqu he lead us into a world of complic charact whose motiv are clear to everyon but themselv the stori read as a bit of a mysteri and a tragedi the reader can t help but ask who is gatsbi a question that is onli answer with hi downfal

The book club I am in recommended this book, and prior to reading it  I saw the play, which was around at the same time.

positive,"Still Amazing and Relevant. Fitzgerald, in one magnificent novel, dramatized the major currents of modern American life -- romantic, social, and economic -- all of which continue to dominate, and often befuddle, our lives. And he managed to accomplish this in the most economical great novel ever written.The idea of romantic love enraptures us so much so we have an entire literary genre devoted to passion. Jay Gatsby worships an idealized love for Daisy Buchanan and the upper class lifestyle she represents. The driving force of his life, from poverty to showy wealth not only springs from his hated of his impoverished early life but from his desire to possess Daisy.While we like to believe that ours is a classless society, we all know that's merely a pleasing illusion. Even when we manage to breakthrough to the top of the economic food chain we can't count on acceptance. The newly wealthy in the late 19th century discovered the impenetrability of the 400 and it's no different for Gatsby. Tom Buchanan, who constantly displays his superiority (in the opening with his racial prejudice, Fitzgerald's allusion to Lothrop Stoddard), regularly demeans Gatsby. In the end, class wins out, as Daisy tosses over Gatsby, a second time, for Buchanan. And we won't go into the psychological implications of Buchanan's affair with Myrtle Wilson, except to marvel at the rich vein Fitzgerald has left us for conjecture.While the lust for wealth isn't anything unique to America, we Americans exhibit a keen zeal for it, and a wondrous capacity for achieving it, by methods fair and foul and in-between the two poles. Jay Gatsby is hardscrabble and comes by his through bootlegging and financial legerdemain. The Buchanan's come by theirs through inheritance, the accumulation of which might have involved not a little bit of ancestral chicanery. Gatsby is nouveau flamboyant. The Buchanans, while more reserved, flaunt theirs, nonetheless.Fitzgerald says a lot in few words. However, he also leaves much unsaid. This invites readers to fill in the open spaces from their various perspectives. Fitzgerald's economy coupled with his astute understanding of American life are what keep

positive,"The Greatest Gatsby there Ever Was. The Great Gatsby is the best comparison of East and West behaviors I’ve ever read. All the events in the story were so gritty and dramatic like in the West, but covered up with poise and glamour from the East. It’s not the most heart-wrenching book I ever read, but it’s certainly the most interesting. These five main characters are all so different but so connected and intertwined at the same time, like an unbroken line of understanding. I think my favorite part was how the entire story was narrated from the outside looking in. Nick Caraway is a 29 year old business man who seems very boring but is rather just shy and being boring feels safe for him. He likes his comfort zone. Gatsby however, is outlandish, extravagant, eccentric, and always charming. He has this sense that life should always be dramatic and full of amazement. He loves to live every day like it’s his last, but the sad part is he feels he needs to be wealthy to do that. Lucky for him he is, hence the wildest parties Long Island has ever seen. I like how Nick is the put together one while Gatsby seems most perfect. To me watching these two characters develop was most interesting. They basically went through the same life, just one simple and careful and the other exorbitantly and haphazardly. I compared their mannerisms and ideals, dreams and fears. Nick was the one who needed to explore life, while Gatsby needed something more down to earth. All in all, you’ll never forget a party a Jay Gatsby’s house.",1528,"the greatest gatsby there ever was. the great gatsby is the best comparison of east and west behaviors i’ve ever read. all the

positive,"Review. The Great Gatsby is one of thse books that seem so confusing in the beginning, but once you get the hang of it, you learn to enjoy, and eventually, love.  Almost everything that happens in the book is completely ironic because in the end, everything is just the opposite of what the author leads you to expect. Even the way the story is written is ironic because although the author uses all kinds of deep and meaningful descriptions about everything, the things he is writing about are the extreme shallowness and pretentiousness of  the people who live in that time. In a way, the story is a satire through and through.  The whole story is a whirlwind of emotions and it practically turns everything from the mood to the environment to the people inside out, and all of it is told from a single person's point of view, which makes it all the easier to imagine that you are actually the one thinking those thoughts.  Also, it becomes very easy to relate to the story when you realize that even if the story takes place in a time long before, every kind of flaw in man is still present today, and a lot of them are featured in the very colorful characters from The Great Gatsby. Traits like immaturity, lovesickness, carelessness, snobbery, etc, were present then and are still present now, and once you realize that you will be able to enjoy the pure humor in the book that the author is probably trying to present to us.  The Great Gatsby is one of the most obscure books that I have ever read, and yet after I read it, a lightbulb appeared in my head and now that I understand it's message, I know that I really enjoyed it and the challenge was wortht the read.",1672,"review. the great gatsby is one of thse books that seem so confusing in the beginning, but once you get the hang of it, you learn to enjoy, and

neutral,"A Layman's Review. The Great Gatsby is a classic and it's considered a masterpiece. I'm not going to pretend I fully grasped the full beauty of this book. I do hope that in the future I will come back to this book and be able to fully appreciate it.With that said, I found this book quite boring. For me, the book didn't pick up till the ""car accident"" and that's towards the end.Good news is that it's only 170 pages and reads fairly fast. I enjoyed the way the book ended and it made me think about the events that lead up to it all.While it was a worthwhile read, there are a lot of other books I would recommend before this one, just a personal opinion.",657,"a layman's review. the great gatsby is a classic and it's considered a masterpiece. i'm not going to pretend i fully grasped the full beauty of this book. i do hope that in the future i will come back to this book and be able to fully appreciate it.with that said, i found this book quite boring. for me, the book didn't pick up till the ""car accident"" and that's towards the end.good news is that it's only 170 pages and reads fairly fast. i enjoyed the way the book ended and it made me think about the events that lead up to it all.while it was a worthwhile read, there are a lot of other books i would recommend before this one, just a personal opinion.",a layman s review the great gatsby is a classic and it s considered a masterpiece i m not going to pretend i fully grasped the full beauty of this book i do hope that in the future i will come back to this book and be able to fully appreciate it with that said i found this book quite boring for me the book didn t pick up till the car accident and that s towards the end good news is that it s only 170 pages and reads fairly fast i enjoyed the way the book ended and it made me think about the events that lead up to it all while it was a worthwhile read there are a lot of other books i would recommend before this one just a personal opinion ,"['a', 'layman', 's', 'review', 'the', 'great', 'gatsby', 'is', 'a', 'classic', 'and', 'it', 's', 'considered', 'a', 'masterpiece', 'i', 'm', 'not', 'going', 'to', 'pretend', 'i', 'fully', 'grasped', 'the', 'full', 'beauty', 'of', 'this', 'book', 'i', 'do', 'hope', 'that', 'in', 'the', 'future', 'i', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'to', 'this', 'book', 'and', 'be', 'able', 'to', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'it', 'with', 'that', 'said', 'i', 'found', 'this', 'book', 'quite', 'boring', 'for', 'me', 'the', 'book', 'didn', 't', 'pick', 'up', 'till', 'the', 'car', 'accident', 'and', 'that', 's', 'towards', 'the', 'end', 'good', 'news', 'is', 'that', 'it', 's', 'only', '170', 'pages', 'and', 'reads', 'fairly', 'fast', 'i', 'enjoyed', 'the', 'way', 'the', 'book', 'ended', 'and', 'it', 'made', 'me', 'think', 'about', 'the', 'events', 'that', 'lead', 'up', 'to', 'it', 'all', 'while', 'it', 'was', 'a', 'worthwhile', 'read', 'there', 'are', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'other', 'books', 'i', 'would', 'recommend', 'before', 'this', 'one', 'just', 'a', 'personal', 'opinion']","['layman', 'review', 'great', 'gatsby', 'classic', 'considered', 'masterpiece', 'going', 'pretend', 'fully', 'grasped', 'full', 'beauty', 'book', 'hope', 'future', 'come', 'back', 'book', 'able', 'fully', 'appreciate', 'said', 'found', 'book', 'quite', 'boring', 'book', 'pick', 'till', 'car', 'accident', 'towards', 'end', 'good', 'news', '170', 'pages', 'reads', 'fairly', 'fast', 'enjoyed', 'way', 'book', 'ended', 'made', 'think', 'events', 'lead', 'worthwhile', 'read', 'lot', 'books', 'would', 'recommend', 'one', 'personal', 'opinion']","['a', 'layman', 's', 'review', 'the', 'great', 'gatsbi', 'is', 'a', 'classic', 'and', 'it', 's', 'consid', 'a', 'masterpiec', 'i', 'm', 'not', 'go', 'to', 'pretend', 'i', 'fulli', 'grasp', 'the', 'full', 'beauti', 'of', 'thi', 'book', 'i', 'do', 'hope', 'that', 'in', 'the', 'futur', 'i', 'will', 'come', 'back', 'to', 'thi', 'book', 'and', 'be', 'abl', 'to', 'fulli', 'appreci', 'it', 'with', 'that', 'said', 'i', 'found', 'thi', 'book', 'quit', 'bore', 'for', 'me', 'the', 'book', 'didn', 't', 'pick', 'up', 'till', 'the', 'car', 'accid', 'and', 'that', 's', 'toward', 'the', 'end', 'good', 'news', 'is', 'that', 'it', 's', 'onli', '170', 'page', 'and', 'read', 'fairli', 'fast', 'i', 'enjoy', 'the', 'way', 'the', 'book', 'end', 'and', 'it', 'made', 'me', 'think', 'about', 'the', 'event', 'that', 'lead', 'up', 'to', 'it', 'all', 'while', 'it', 'wa', 'a', 'worthwhil', 'read', 'there', 'are', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'other', 'book', 'i', 'would', 'recommend', 'befor', 'thi', 'one', 'just', 'a', 'person', 'opinion']", a layman s review the great gatsbi is a classic and it s consid a masterpiec i m not go to pretend i fulli grasp the full beauti of thi book i do hope that in the futur i will come back to thi book and be abl to fulli appreci it with that said i found thi book quit bore for me the book didn t pick up till the car accid and that s toward the end good news is that it s onli 170 page and read fairli fast i enjoy the way the book end and it made me think about the event that lead up to it all while it wa a worthwhil read there are a lot of other book i would recommend befor thi one just a person opinion
positive,"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.. There is something to be said about a literary work of art that endures the passage time. The Great Gatsby was published in April of 1925 and is still read and enjoyed today.The story takes place during the summer of 1922, during the Roaring Twenties and is set in a wealthy town in Long Island. It is narrated by Nick Carraway, a Yale grad and now Gatsby’s next-door neighbor.As we see the story through Nick’s eyes, we meet a cast of characters including his cousin Daisy Fay Buchanan and her husband Tom. Tom and Daisy are not what you would call a loving couple and Tom has a mistress named Myrtle. Daisy is Gatsby’s long lost love. The war separated them years ago and Daisy married Tom while he was away.Nick finally gets invited to one of Gatsby’s lavish parties and becomes friends with him. As the story flows we see more about the elusive Gatsby and his life and background and learn where his wealth came from.I am a sucker for long lost loves who are reunited but somehow still have the odds stacked against them. Timing is everything and sometimes timing just stinks. Gatsby does everything he can to win Daisy back and just to see her once more. So the love story here grabbed me and made me love the character of Jay Gatsby himself. His love for Daisy was selfless and enduring.The reason I disliked reading Gatsby was the pacing of it. It might have been because Nick seemed bland to me. I just couldn’t connect with him. I also think it was because we are seeing the story through his eyes. I wanted to see it from Gatsby’s point of view since so much of it is around his life. Getting the story from Nick however, continues to keep Gatsby at an arms length, mainly elusive, mysterious. The author brings the 1920’s setting to life and I did enjoy that.F. Scott Fitzgerald dedicated The Great Gatsby to his wife Zelda. I want to read Tender Is the Night which I’ve heard is partially based on the author’s own life.Although I found the pacing slow at times, I truly enjoyed this one. I found myself re-reading and savoring several passages.",2138,"so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.. there is something to be said about a literary work of

negative,"A mild soap opera and no masterpiece. Hmm, looks like the literary critics got it wrong again when they pushed this book into the university reading lists. This is nothing more than an adequately written soap opera of a love triangle that ends in tragedy. I expected great writing; I found the author's writing to be merely adequate and the characters to be wooden. The story is of the lowest common denominator type: a sleazy romance that would have been equally at home in the Harlequin Romance series. The supposedly brilliant portrayal of the Jazz Age was anything but. I am a big twenties fan and know a good deal about the period and Fitzgerald certainly did not capture the feeling of the period for me. The twenties were about Jazz in New Orleans and Chicago, movies in Hollywood, hustle and bustle in Manhattan, not about some spoiled and bored people in Long Island who don't know what to do with themselves (how could anyone have been bored in the 1920's ???!!! There was a good reason why they called it the Jazz Age; it was exciting - to everyone but the clueless numbskulls in this novel). Daisy is supposedly irresistable; she comes across as the twenties version of a valley girl. Any grown man moronic enough to fall for her deserves what he gets. Gatsby is as wooden as any toy soldier.Why, oh why, do academics go crazy over these novels? I think it is because they spend so much time in academia that they have no sense of life outside of universities. I bet there really are professors out there who think that this is a daring, explosive novel. The rest of us, living less rarified lives, respond with a big yawn.",1635,"a mild soap opera and no masterpiece. hmm, looks like the literary critics got it wrong again when they pushed this book

themselves (how could anyone have been bored in the 1920's ???!!! there was a good reason why they called it the jazz age; it was exciting - to everyone but the clueless numbskulls in this novel). daisy is supposedly irresistable; she comes across as the twenties version of a valley girl. any grown man moronic enough to fall for her deserves what he gets. gatsby is as wooden as any toy soldier.why, oh why, do academics go crazy over these novels? i think it is because they spend so much time in academia that they have no sense of life outside of universities. i bet there really are professors out there who think that this is a daring, explosive novel. the rest of us, living less rarified lives, respond with a big yawn.",a mild soap opera and no masterpiece hmm looks like the literary critics got it wrong again when they pushed this book into the university reading lists this is nothing more than an adequately written soap opera of a love triangle that ends in tragedy i expected great writing i found the author s writing to be merely adequate and the characters to be wooden the story is of the lowest common denominator type a sleazy romance that would have been

positive,"""I have decided to be a pure artist + experiment in form and emotion."" F. Scott Fitzgerald on Gatsby. I reread this in two days, in conjunction with a terrific new biography of Fitzgerald, ""Paradise Lost,"" by David S. Brown. I was amazed most by The Great Gatsby's romance, its plotting, its implicit commentary about American social values and ethics as the new century took hold after WW I and Americans saw fortunes to be made. Class and racial distinctions, along with anti-Semitism, were just part of the landscape and are presented as such, as if in a time capsule revealing what everyone just accepted. What is timeless about this book, which many consider the Great American Novel of the 20th century (""Moby Dick"" being the 19th century's Great American Novel), are the complex psychological portraits of its characters (Daisy, Nick, Tom, Jay, Jordan, George Wilson,), the sweeping scope of its portrait of America, which still holds up today, the beauty of its descriptive prose, and the poetry of its shimmering romance. It's a wonderful piece of art that deserves its place high up in the American literary canon. This novel overturned all the Victorian claptrap of 19th century literature and consciously focused on the real and modern world, complete with ""immoral"" behavior, drinking, totally selfish and unethical people, and the drive for freedom from hypocritical piety.
